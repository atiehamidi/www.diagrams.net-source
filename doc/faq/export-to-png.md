PNGs are used in web pages, documents and presentation slides. You can also [export your diagram as a high resolution PNG for printing](/doc/faq/export-higher-resolution.html).

1. Click _File > Export As > PNG_.
2. Change the export settings to suit your requirements.
   * Choose the _Zoom_ factor, set a _Border_ width around your diagram, and enable the checkboxes if you want a _Transparent Background_, a _Shadow_ on your shapes, or to include the _Grid_ of the drawing canvas. 
   * If you only want to export the shapes and connectors that are currently selected, enable the _Selection only_ checkbox. 
   * Make sure the checkbox to _Include a copy of my diagram_ is selected if you want to be able to open your diagram and edit it again when you import the PNG file into draw.io.
