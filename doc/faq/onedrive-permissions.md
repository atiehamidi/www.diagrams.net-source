OneDrive provides one single level of access, which is to grant permission to diagrams.net to access _all_ files in your OneDrive account.

Unfortunately, OneDrive does not provide more granular permissions that would let you share your diagrams with other users. [Dropbox has the same problem](/doc/faq/share-diagram/dropbox.html). At this time, only Google Drive implements file sharing in a reasonable way.

To work around this limitation in One Drive, [download the desktop version of diagrams.net](https://get.diagrams.net/) and work on the synchronised local copy of your OneDrive files.
