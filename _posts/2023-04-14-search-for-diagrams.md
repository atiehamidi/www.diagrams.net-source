Diagrams are growing in popularity worldwide, and search trends reflect this in interesting ways. By comparing various search phrases in Google Trends, we can see that "how to diagram" has been pretty stable over the past 20 years. But now, people are also searching for which type of diagram to use and when they would be best put to use.

Let's dig a little deeper into these diagramming search trends. 

## Flowcharts, mind maps or org charts?
Of the three most popular types of diagrams used in organisations, especially in meetings, which would win out of flowcharts, mind maps or organisation charts? 

Unsurprisingly, [flowcharts](/doc/getting-started-basic-flow-chart.html) are the most popular - they are used to document processes in all types of industries and teams. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/search-trends-flow-mind-org-chart.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Flowcharts are more popular than mind maps and org charts">

[BPMN diagrams](/blog/bpmn-2-0.html), cross-functional flowcharts and [swimlane diagrams](/blog/swimlane-diagrams.html), dataflow diagrams, [gitflows](/blog/gitflow-feature-flags.html), and value stream maps are more specialised forms of flowcharts, and all searched for at roughly the same rate.

## Which teams diagram the most?
If you work in this field, you'll not be surprised that IT diagrams are the leading search phrase, much more than business diagrams, marketing diagrams and training diagrams all combined. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/search-trends-team-diagrams.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Diagrams in IT are more often searched for than business, marketing and training diagrams combined">

It's mostly likely because software and technology is increasingly more complex, and therefore easier to document visually in diagrams.

### Different types of diagrams in IT

It was a little surprising to see [network diagrams](/blog/network-diagrams.html) decrease in the long term search trend, but perhaps people are now searching more often for cloud infrastructure diagrams. Or perhaps network management tools are automatically documenting their infrastructure for them.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/search-trends-it-diagrams.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="While UML and network diagrams are less often searched for, mockups and user flows are becoming more popular">

[UML diagrams](/search?search=uml) have been losing popularity over time - they can be quite time consuming to draw and maintain for complex software products. When looking at the different types of UML diagrams, class diagrams are still regularly searched for.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/class-diagram-example.png" style="width=100%;max-width:300px;height:auto;" alt="A class diagram based on the basic class diagram template in draw.io">

Reflecting today's faster software development and release cycles, the search trends clearly show that mockups and user flows are increasingly popular.
<br />[<img src="/assets/img/blog/feature-flag-control-interface-mockup.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="The best way to control which feature flags are enabled or disabled, and set user target segment rules is via a visual interface">](https://app.diagrams.net/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&page=1&title=#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fjgraph%2Fdrawio-diagrams%2Fdev%2Fblog%2Ffeature-flag-control-interface-mockup.drawio)
<br />_Mockups - like this feature-flag control panel - are easily created in draw.io_


### Business diagrams for project management

The most popular business diagrams searched for are used to explore and justify business and project management decisions. 

[<img src="/assets/img/blog/ishikawa-example.png" style="width=100%;max-width:250px;height:auto;" alt="The structure of an Ishikawa diagram resembles a fish skeleton, where the ribs are the categories and their sub-branches are root-causes, all leading to the problem or defect on the right">](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&page=3&title=#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fjgraph%2Fdrawio-diagrams%2Fmaster%2Fblog%2Fishikawa-diagram-examples.drawio)

While [fishbone diagrams](/blog/ishikawa-diagrams.html) for root cause analyses of problems, have been a constant search phrase over the past twenty years, both decision trees and Gantt charts have seen minor popularity dips. Both popular search terms right now, however.

We're a little confused - what happened in 2015 to cause the spike in searches for ["Venn" diagrams](/blog/venn-diagrams.html)?

## Diagram software, tool or app?

When looking for a way to draw a diagram, do you search for diagram software, diagram tool or diagram app? 

These days, app is gaining ground fast, probably because everyone has mobile devices.

And because we were curious, of the common [wrong spellings of draw.io](/blog/diagrams-other-names.html), drow.io has been the most popular in the past three years. Drizzt won't notice.
