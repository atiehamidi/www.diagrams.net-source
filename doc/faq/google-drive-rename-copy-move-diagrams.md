## Work with diagram files stored in Google Drive

Storing your files in Google Drive lets you and your teams collaborate easily. Your [diagram files in Google Drive are versioned](/doc/faq/google-drive-revision-history.html) - you can see who makes changes and when, and roll back to an older version if someone has made a mistake. [Publishing a diagram as a link from a diagram stored in Google Drive](/doc/faq/google-drive-publicly-publish-diagram.html) results in shorter, more readable links. You can [import diagrams into Google Drive](/doc/faq/google-drive-import-diagram.html) in a number of ways, both in and out of the draw.io editor. 

To return to Google Drive from the draw.io editor, hover over the draw.io logo at the top left. It will change to the Google Drive logo and display a tooltip - click on it to automatically save your diagram and return to your Google Drive.

**Embed diagrams in Google Docs, Slides and Sheets** 

Using the draw.io apps for Google Workplace, you can [add diagrams from Google Drive to Google Docs](/blog/diagrams-google-docs.html) and other Google Workplace apps, without needing to create and embed a static image version of your diagram.

**Embed diagrams from Google Drive in Atlassian Confluence and Jira**

If you are using the draw.io apps for [Atlassian Confluence](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1210933/draw-io-diagrams-for-confluence?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) or [Atlassian Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211413/draw-io-diagrams-for-jira?hosting=datacenter&tab=overview), use the _Embed draw.io diagram_ macro to embed a diagram file that you have stored in Google Drive. 

If you don't see this option when using Confluence Server, your Confluence administrator will need to [enable it in the draw.io configuration options](/doc/faq/googledrive-onedrive-integration-enable-confluence-server.html).
