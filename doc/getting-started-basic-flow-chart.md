categories: [features]
---

You can create many different types of diagrams with draw.io and [our online diagram editor](https://app.diagrams.net). To learn how to use the editor, let's start with a basic [flowchart](/example-diagrams.html#flowcharts) to document a process.

Flow charts let you visually describe a process or system. The shapes and very short labels let readers quickly understand what they need to do.

## Add shapes to the drawing canvas

There are a number of different ways to add shapes to the drawing canvas in draw.io.

**Add the first step** - Use one of the following methods to add a rectangle to the drawing canvas. Rectangles represent the steps in your process.

* Click on a rectangle in the _General_ shape library to add it the drawing canvas.
* Double-click on an empty area on the drawing canvas and select a rectangle shape.
* Drag a rectangle from the _General_ shape library to a specific position on the drawing canvas.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/basic-flow-add-shape.gif" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" alt="Add a rectangle - click on it in the shape library, double click on a blank area, or drag it from the shape library">

**Add more shapes** - Use one of the following methods to add extra shapes to represent the next steps in your process.
* Hover over the first shape you placed to see the four direction arrows. Click on one of the shapes, then select a shape to add and connect it in that direction.
* Drag a shape from the shape library and hover over an existing shape until you can see the four direction arrows. Move over one of these direction arrows, and drop the shape you have dragged. It will be added to the drawing canvas and connected in that direction.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/basic-flow-add-connect-shape.gif" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" alt="Add a second shape and connect it from the first - hover and click on the direction arrow, or drag a shape over another and drop it on a direction arrow">

If you added multiple shapes by simply clicking on them in the shape library, you can connect them later. See [how to connect shapes below](#connect-shapes).

**Shapes for flow charts**

There are many different shapes used to visualise processes in a flow chart.

* **Rectangle** - Basic steps in your process.
* **Diamond (rhombus)** - Decisions, usually yes/no questions, that split the process into two or more branches.
* **Circle or oval** - Optional start and stop points in your process.
* **Parallelogram** - Input or output, where your process needs or gives information to an external party or system.
* **Cylinder** - Disk drives, used to indicate that data is stored during that step in the process.
* **Rectangle with a wavy bottom line** - Documents that are produced as a result of a process step.

In addition to the shapes in the _General_ and _Advanced_ shape libraries, you can use shapes from the _Flowchart_ shape library.

1. Click on _More Shapes_ at the bottom of the left panel.
2. Click on the checkbox next to the _Flowchart_ shape library's name to enable it.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/shape-library-dialog.png" style="width=100%;max-width:300px;height:auto;" alt="Select the shape libraries you want to work with in draw.io">
3. Click _Apply_. The _Flowchart_ shape library is now available in the left panel.

<br />
## Move, resize, rotate, and delete shapes

To select a shape, click on it. To [select multiple shapes](/doc/faq/select-multiple-shapes.html), hold down ``Shift`` or ``Cmd`` and click on them.

**Move** - Select and drag a shape that is on the drawing canvas to another position.

**Resize** - Select a shape. Drag any of the round 'grab' handles to make the shape smaller or larger. Hold down ``Control`` when you resize shapes to keep them centred.
<br />[See how to resize groups of shapes](/doc/faq/shape-resize.html)

**Rotate** - Select a shape. Drag the rotate grab handle (the round arrow) at the top right corner of the shape to [rotate the shape](/blog/rotate-shapes.html) around its center point.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/rotate.png" style="width=100%;max-width:300px;height:auto;" alt="Rotate a shape using the rotate grab handle">

**Delete** - Select a shape, then press ``Backspace`` or ``Delete``, or click on the _Delete_ tool in the toolbar.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/basic-flow-move-resize-rotate-delete.gif" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Move, resize, rotate and delete shapes in draw.io">

If one of the connectors, the arrows between the shapes, is going in the wrong direction, you can select and delete it, just like a shape. Follow the steps below to [draw a new connector](#draw-a-floating-connector) so it goes in the right direction.

**Tip:** Use the _Arrange_ tab to [precisely rotate, reposition and resize shapes](/doc/faq/arrange-tab.html)

<br />
## Connect shapes

Connectors are lines that [connect your shapes together](/blog/connect-shapes.html) and may or may not have arrows at one or both ends. There are two types of connectors.

**Floating connectors** - These move around the perimeter of your shape as you move it around the drawing canvas, or change the route that the connector takes.

**Fixed connectors** - These stay attached to a fixed point on your shape, even when you move the shape around the drawing canvas.

### Draw a floating connector

1. Hover over the source shape until you see the light direction arrows appear.
2. Move your mouse cursor over the direction arrow you want to draw the connector from, then drag the connector out from the arrow towards the target shape.
3. Hover over the target shape and release when the outline of the shape is blue.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/basic-flow-floating-connector.gif" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Draw  a floating connectors between shapes in draw.io">

When you move the shape to a new position, the connector ends will automatically move around the shape to ensure the shortest distance.

### Draw a fixed connector

1. Hover over the source shape until you see the little crosses, connection points, around the shape perimeter.
2. Drag a connector from the connection point on the source shape towards the target shape.
3. Hover over the target shape until you see the connection points, then hover over one of the connection points until it is highlighted in green, and release to attach the connector.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/basic-flow-fixed-connector.gif" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Draw  a fixed connectors between shapes in draw.io">

Now when you drag the shape around on the drawing canvas, the connector will remain attached to exactly those connection points.

### Change the path of a connector

Waypoints are shown as small circles on a selected connector. They are used to define the path that a connector takes across the drawing canvas.

1. Select the connector that you want to change the path of to see its waypoints.
2. Drag one of the waypoints into a new position. New waypoints will be added automatically based on where you grabbed the connector and where you move your mouse too.

If it is a floating connector, the end closest to the waypoints you moved will 'float' around the perimeter of your shape. If it is a fixed connector, the end will remain attached to that specific connection point.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/basic-flow-move-connector.gif" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Change the path of a connector between shapes in draw.io">

You can [add and remove waypoints](/blog/waypoints-connectors.html) to make connectors follow complex paths.

<br />
## Add labels

Short labels on shapes make it easier to understand a diagram quickly.

1. Double click on a shape. Start typing to replace the label with your own text. Alternatively, single click on a shape and start typing to add or edit the label.
2. Press ``Enter`` to save the label text.

**Tip:** Press ``Shift+Enter`` to [add a line break in a label](/doc/faq/line-breaks.html).

<img src="/assets/img/blog/basic-flow-add-labels.gif" style="width=100%;max-width:500px;height:auto;" alt="Add labels to shapes and connectors in draw.io">

**Connector labels**

You can add more than one label to a connector - at the source end, the target end, and in the middle.

* Double click in the position you want to add a text label there.
* To reposition the connector label text, click on the label, then drag the small yellow diamond to a new position.

If you reroute the connector, you may need to update any labels you had manually positioned, but usually the label will move intelligently with the connector.

<br />
## Style your flow chart

Once you have finished adding all the shapes, connectors and labels, you can style your flow chart.

1. Select a shape, or hold ``Shift`` down and click on multiple shapes and connectors to select many.

2. Add colours and [style your shapes](/doc/faq/shape-styles.html) and [connectors](/doc/faq/connector-styles.html) via the _Style_ tab.
   * The style palette at the top of the _Style_ tab changes both the fill and outline colour. Click the left or right arrows to view more styles.

   * To set your own colour, click on the colour button next to _Fill_ or _Line_, select a a new colour or enter a hex colour code.
   <br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/colour-picker.png" style="width=100%;max-width:200px;height:auto;" alt="Choose a colour from the default or larger colour palette, or enter your own hex colour code">
   * Style a selected connector to have [arrows on both ends](/doc/faq/connector-bidirectional.html) or [no arrows](/doc/faq/connector-no-arrows.html).
   <br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/basic-flow-connector-arrows.png" style="width=100%;max-width:200px;height:auto;" alt="Select an arrow or another connector end style at both the target and source shape in draw.io">
3. [Change the text style](/doc/faq/text-styles.html) of labels on the _Text_ tab.
   * Select a different _Font_ from the list.
   * Add _Bold_, _Italics_, or _Underline_.
   * Change the justification to be left, right or centred.
   * Click on the colour button next to _Font Color_.
   <br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/basic-flow-text-tab.png" style="width=100%;max-width:200px;height:auto;" alt="Style label text via the Text tab in the format panel in draw.io">   

**Tip:** When you edit the text itself, you will see additional HTML formatting - add a numbered or bulleted list, indent your text, use superscript or subscript text and more.

<br />
## Export and share your flow chart

You can share your diagram in a number of different ways via the _File > Export as_ menu. The most common export formats are as images or as a URL.

* Export as a _PNG_, _JPEG_ or _SVG_ to convert your diagram to an image that you can paste into a website or email.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/basic-flow-export-as-png.png" style="width=100%;max-width:300px;height:auto;" alt="Export your diagram as an image to share it in an email or publish it on a webpage or in a document"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="/assets/img/blog/basic-flow.png" style="width=100%;max-width:200px;height:auto;" alt="The diagram exported as a PNG image">
* [Export as a _URL_](/blog/export-url.html) to encode your entire diagram in a URL. When you share this (very long) URL, the person viewing the diagram will see a copy - they don't open or edit your original diagram.
