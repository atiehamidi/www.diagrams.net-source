Dropbox limits apps to storing files below the _app_ folder. The subfolders below the _app_ folder are not shareable. Due to this limitation, sharing a diagram file via Dropbox is not currently possible.

Even if you move the draw.io app folder to a different shareable folder within Dropbox and open a diagram file, Dropbox will automatically move the diagram back into a subfolder under the _app_ folder when you save the diagram.

This is a limitation of the Dropbox app folder architecture: they only allow apps to write to a specific folder and that folder cannot be shared.

At this time, only Google Drive implements file sharing in a reasonable way.
