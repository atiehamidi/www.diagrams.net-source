3. Select how you want to open the diagram file, click on either _Open in New Window_ or on _Open in This Window_ (then click _Discard Changes_). Your browser may let you save this choice so that you aren't prompted every time you open a diagram file. Your diagram will be loaded into the editor.

## Import a diagram file 

You can import diagram files into an existing diagram by dragging the file and dropping it on the drawing canvas, via the menu with _File > Import_, including ``.drawio`` and ``.xml`` diagram files, Gliffy, Lucidchart and ``.vsdx`` diagrams.

To force diagrams.net to import the file, even when you have added shapes to drawing canvas, hold ``Shift`` as you drop the file to import it to a new browser tab.
