Autosize allows you to fit the outer size of your shapes to the height of their text labels in draw.io.

1. Select the shapes you want to resize. If you want to resize all shapes, select _Edit > Select Vertices_ or press ``Ctrl+Shift+I`` on Windows and ``Cmd+Shift+I`` on macOS.
2. Go to the _Arrange_ tab in the format panel, and click on the _Autosize_ button.

**Tip:** Use the autosize keyboard shortcut ``Ctrl+Shift+Y`` on Windows or ``Cmd+Shift+Y`` on macOS.

**Note:** Autosize ignores the _Constrain Proportions_ checkbox when it sets the height of a shape to the height of its text label.
