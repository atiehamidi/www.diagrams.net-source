When you draw a freehand shape in diagrams.net, it is saved as an image with a transparent background on the drawing canvas by default. You can change the freehand-drawn shape's style like you would many other shapes: line colour, fill colour, opacity and more. You can also resize, flip and rotate your freehand drawing.

## Add a new freehand drawing 

1. Open the _Freehand_ panel. You can move this panel so it doesn't obstruct where you want to draw.
* Select _Arrange > Insert > Freehand_.
* If you are using the [Sketch editor theme](/blog/diagram-editor-theme.html) or the [draw.io Board macro in Confluence](/blog/drawio-board-macro.html), click on the _Freehand_ tool in the toolbar.

2. Click and hold to draw a freehand line on the drawing canvas.

**Use the freehand brush**

The freehand brush can draw different line widths. Click the _Brush_ checkbox and move the slider to the width you want to use.

### Stop drawing

Stop drawing in one of the following ways.
* Press ``Esc``.
* Click on _Stop drawing_ in the _Freehand_ floating panel. 
* Close the _Freehand_ panel.
* Click on the drawing canvas without moving the mouse.
* Style the freehand shape you just drew in the format panel on the right. 
* Add a new shape from the shape libraries.
* In the Sketch editor theme, click again on _Freehand_ in the toolbar on the left.

To draw another freehand shape after you have previously stopped drawing, click on _Start Drawing_ in the floating _Freehand_ dialog.

**Tip:** Freehand drawing also works on mobile devices, using your finger or a smart pen to tap and draw instead of the mouse.


## Add a label to your freehand shape

1. Double-click on the freehand shape you have finished drawing. 
2. Enter the label text, and style it using the _Text_ tab in the format panel.

**Tip:** If you want to use multiple text formats inside your label, make sure the _Formatted Text_ checkbox is selected. 

## Style your freehand shape 

Select the shape and use the _Style_ tab of the format panel to style your freehand shape. 
* Change the colour using the style palette or add a custom _Fill_ and _Line_ colour.
* Change the style by selecting a different one from the _Line_ drop-down list, width of the line by change the number next to the line style.
* Change the _Opacity_, add a _Shadow_, or use the _Sketch_ style. 
* Expand the _Properties_ at the bottom of the _Style_ tab of the format panel to change many more style settings on your freehand shape.

## Resize, rotate and reposition a freehand shape

You can change the size, rotation angle and position of a freehand shape, just like you would any other shape. 
* **Resize:** Drag the round grab handles of a selected freehand shape to resize it, or edit the _Width_ and _Height_ values in the _Arrange_ tab of the format panel. If you want the freehand shape to be resized proportionally, make sure _Constrain Proportions_ is selected in the _Arrange_ tab.
* **Rotate:** Drag the circular arrow in the top right of a selected freehand shape, or enter a new _Angle_ in the _Arrange_ tab of the format panel. Alternatively, _Flip_ the shape horizontally or vertically via the _Arrange_ tab.
* **Reposition:** Drag the freehand shape to a new position on the drawing canvas, or enter a new _Position_ in the _Arrange_ tab of the format panel. Bring it to the front or send it to the back by clicking _To Front_ or _To Back_ in the _Arrange tab_.

## Use connectors with freehand shapes

1. Drag the end of a connector to a freehand shape to connect them like you would any other shape. 
2. Drop the connector when you see a blue highlight for a floating connector, or when the highlight is green for a fixed connector.
