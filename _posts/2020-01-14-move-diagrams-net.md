The reference implementation of the draw.io project will be hosted at app.diagrams.net. Everything else remains the same - the online editor has all the functionality of the draw.io core editor.

## .io domains

There are two major problems with .io domains:

- The first is that the islands which should own the domain suffix, don't, thanks to a [wonderful piece of modern day British Imperialism](https://gigaom.com/2014/06/30/the-dark-side-of-io-how-the-u-k-is-making-web-domain-profits-from-a-shady-cold-war-land-deal/). If you ever feel the need to donate to us, [please give it to a more worthy cause](https://www.chagossupport.org.uk/).

- Secondly, there was a security issue with the .io domain. In 2017, a researcher managed to take [control of four of the seven authoritative name servers for the .io domain](https://thehackerblog.com/the-io-error-taking-control-of-all-io-domains-with-a-targeted-registration/). We accept that mistakes can happen, strong processes limit the chances of them happening, but they still can.

However, the domain administrator made no attempt, at any time, to communicate with anyone about the issue. We've no evidence to suggest there is anything to be worried about, but the complete lack of communications means we have lost trust in whoever controls .io domains.

## draw.io in Atlassian

draw.io will remain as-is within Atlassian. Our partnership in that ecosystem with [//SEIBERT/MEDIA](https://seibert-media.com) will continue in the same way for a long time to come.

Our draw.io documentation and official blog will move away from the .io domain to [drawio.com](https://drawio.com).

## What's next?

Our web site at [www.drawio.com](https://www.drawio.com) is focused on the core open source project and the reference implementation at [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net).

We are testing https://app.diagrams.net to check everything that works on the old draw.io domain works there. Don't switch away from www.draw.io just yet.

When we're happy with the new app sub-domain we'll mark it as the canonical domain and file open requests from Google Drive will be sent there.

## What do I need to do?

Hopefully, nothing. If you use draw.io within your group or company, maybe send a message to let your colleagues know the name is changing. There is time to feedback any concerns you may have.

If you have questions, please post them to [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/drawio](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/drawio). If it's technical you can open an [issue at GitHub](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/issues).
