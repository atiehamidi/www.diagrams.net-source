As new features are added to draw.io and the menu is refined, new keyboard shortcuts are also built into the editor. Here are some of the new and useful shortcuts for diagramming in draw.io. 

## Move selected shapes and connectors 

First, select the shape you want to move, then hold ``Shift+Alt+drag`` and drag the cursor to reposition them. You can move shapes, connectors, or multiple selected shapes and connectors this way.

This shortcut will always move the selected elements, even if they are not currently under the cursor when you drag it. 

**Note:** When you move a connector this way, it will de-attach itself from the source and target shapes, unless they are moved with the connector.

## Increase/decrease font size

Select a shape or connector or label, and press ``Ctrl+Shift +/- (NumPad)`` to increase or decrease the text size. 

This only works with the ``+`` and ``-`` keys on the number pad.

Alternatively, change the font size in the _Text_ tab of the format panel. 

**Note:** This keyboard shortcut will always change the text size of the entire label, even if you have selected only some text inside a label. 

## Increase/decrease shape size 

Select a shape, and press ``Ctrl+Shift+arrow key`` to increase or decrease the right or lower edge of the shape. This increases or decreases the _Height_ or _Width_ of the shape (in the _Arrange_ tab of the format panel).

## Clear all extra waypoints on a connector

Waypoints are used in connectors to change its path. Sometimes you may want to remove all of them quickly. 

Select a connector and press ``Alt+Shift+R`` to reset the waypoints back to the default path.
