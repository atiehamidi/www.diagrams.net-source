It was quite a year. We want to take this opportunity to thank you for your support, look back at some of the features we've added and updated.

**To our diagram editor users** 

Whether you use our web-based [draw.io app](https://app.diagrams.net) or one of our [draw.io integrations](/integrations.html), or our standalone [desktop app](https://get.diagrams.net/), thank you for your support, feedback, and participation in our [Google forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/drawio) and [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/discussions). 

**To our open-source contributors and sponsors** 

Also to our development and support team, translators, bug reporters, and [open-source sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/jgraph#sponsors) - we love that you love our secure diagramming app. Thank you for your support and contributions this year.

**To those open-source projects and developers we sponsor**

Particularly Henning Dieterichs ([unofficial draw.io extension for VSCode](https://github.com/hediet/vscode-drawio)), Preet ([rough style for shapes](https://github.com/rough-stuff/rough)) and Dan Brown, but we'd like to thank all those we sponsor for your contributions to the open-source community and our application.

## New features and updates in 2022

The biggest and most recent new draw.io feature is our redesigned toolbar and menu for a distraction-free diagram editor. 

The [new modern mode](/blog/modern-mode-diagrams.html) takes the best parts of all of our editor themes and blends them together with a simple, responsive toolbar and large drawing canvas. To switch to this mode, click on the sun/moon in the top right, and deselect _Classic_.

* draw.io users in Confluence Server/Data Center can [apply a sensitive label](/blog/drawio-sensitive-label.html) to exclude diagrams from recent lists and search.

* draw.io users in Confluence, and with Google Drive and Microsoft One Drive can see each others' mouse cursors in real time as they collaboratively edit a diagram.

* Improvements were made to the mass Gliffy import and [Confluence instance migration](/doc/faq/migrate-drawio-confluence.html) tools for draw.io users. 

* Shape libraries have been expanded and updated with new icons - particularly the Azure, AWS, Google Cloud and SysML shape libraries. 

* You can [add and edit translations within the shape labels](/blog/translate-diagrams.html) as shape metadata - no need to keep separate diagrams for separate languages.

* The editor was translated into new languages - Lithuanian and Latvian.

* Switch between [dark and light modes](/blog/change-editor-mode.html) without having to reload the browser tab - click on the sun/moon in the top right and select _Dark_.

* A [connection point editor tool](/blog/edit-connection-points.html) was added - you can now easily customise the fixed connection points for any shape on the drawing canvas.

* Swap existing shapes on the drawing canvas by holding down ``Shift`` as you drag one over the other. Flip connectors and groups of shapes via the Arrange tab on the format panel.

* Number shapes and connectors with the built-in enumerate property (to replace the number plugin).

* To [run your own diagramming server](/blog/diagrams-docker-app.html), you can use our Docker image of draw.io for secure and private diagramming behind your firewall.

* Freehand drawing was updated with a variable size brush, which works well with a tablet and pen. 
<br />[<img src="/assets/img/blog/freehand-crow.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Freehand drawing in draw.io on a tablet - click the freehand tool in the toolbar on the left">](/blog/freehand-drawing.html)

* Several advanced tools and features were updated, including Mermaid import, mathematics typesetting, rough style, CSV import, image cropping, font mapping, SVG export, drag and drop diagram import, and more.

* [More integrations](/integrations.html) with a wider range of tools for built-in diagramming - thanks to the developers who have integrated our open-source diagram editor.

And, of course, our team also published a mountain of bug fixes, security patches and smaller optimisation changes to both the [web version of draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net) and our own [draw.io app integrations](/integrations.html).
