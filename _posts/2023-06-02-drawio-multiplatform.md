Unlike many software companies, our team develops draw.io using their preferred operating system and browser - whether that is Windows, macOS or Linux, and Firefox, Chrome, Safari or Edge. We each prefer a different combination of OS and browser, an ideal way to ensure draw.io works everywhere.

## Web applications are cross-platform

As draw.io is a web application, it is naturally cross-platform - it works on all operating systems and in all modern browsers. 

Such web applications like draw.io get cached in your browser, but different browsers cache web applications inconsistently. We release editor updates several times a month, so to see the new draw.io functionality, or troubleshoot any odd behaviour in the editor, you should clear your browser's cache.

Follow these links to reset only the draw.io app data that is stored in your browser. 

* [http://clear.diagrams.net](http://clear.diagrams.net) for the web version of our editor
* [http://clear.draw.io](http://clear.draw.io) if you use draw.io for Confluence

**Tip:** If you are using [draw.io Desktop](https://get.diagrams.net/), select _Help > Check for Updates_ from the menu. If a newer version is available, follow the prompts to install it.

**Diagram on mobile devices too**

For a larger and less cluttered drawing canvas, touch screen users see draw.io's [new modern mode](/blog/modern-mode-diagrams.html) or [Sketch whiteboard editor theme](/blog/sketch-online-whiteboard.html) by default, including those diagramming in Confluence on mobile devices. Click on the toolbars and menu to open any other panels and dialogs you need.

If you prefer to use the classic interface, select a new theme via the menu, or tap on the sun/moon in the top right and switch modes.

## Diagram directly in your content platform

You aren't limited to using draw.io in your browser, or our standalone desktop app. You can diagram wherever you work.

In **Atlassian [Confluence](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1210933/draw-io-diagrams-for-confluence)** and [Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211413/draw-io-diagrams-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) - with extra functionality for [mass importing diagrams](/doc/faq/mass-import-gliffy-confluence-cloud.html), version control, extended search, [editor customisation](/doc/drawio-confluence-cloud-admin.html), a list of all diagrams, and more.

Using **Google Workplace** or [Google Classroom](/blog/google-classroom-diagrams.html) - embed diagrams in [Docs](https://docsaddon.diagrams.net/), [Sheets](https://sheetsaddon.diagrams.net/), and [Slides](https://slidesaddon.diagrams.net/), and store diagram files in [Google Drive](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=google).

With **Microsoft Office** - embed diagrams in [Word, Powerpoint and Excel](https://office.diagrams.net/), discuss diagrams in [Teams](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA200003444), and store diagram files in [Microsoft OneDrive](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=onedrive).

**Tip:** draw.io for Confluence, Google Drive, and OneDrive all provide you with [real-time collaboration with shared cursors](/blog/real-time-collaboration-diagrams.html) on shared diagrams.

### Browser extensions to integrate diagramming

Many third-parties have [integrated the draw.io editor](/integrations.html)  into their content platforms with browser and application extensions. 

* Use our [draw.io for Notion extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/drawio-for-notion/plhaalebpkihaccllnkdaokdoeaokmle) for the Chrome browser to embed your diagram files into Notion pages and databases. 

* This [draw.io app for Nextcloud](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/drawio) integrates the diagram editor into this cloud platform.

* With the unofficial [draw.io extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio), you can edit diagrams stored in your GitHub and GitLab repositories directly in the code editor, or via your preferred browser with [github.dev](/blog/edit-diagrams-with-github-dev.html).
