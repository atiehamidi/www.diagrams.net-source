diagrams.net and the draw.io branded Atlassian integrations are the leading solution for web based sketching and diagramming functionality. The article describes the draw.io integration for Confluence that we, JGraph, build, deliver and maintain alongside the online diagrams.net and desktop tools.

Confluence Cloud is a popular tool for team productivity suitable for both small and large organisations. Atlassian provides customers with free instances, as long as the instance has ten users or fewer, and you can diagram in these instances with our draw.io Confluence Cloud integration.

**Diagram freely**

With the draw.io app installed in your free Confluence Cloud instance, you and your small team can draw a wide range of diagrams: 
* flowcharts, business process diagrams, and [gitflows](/blog/gitflow-diagram.html)
* mindmaps, org charts, and tree diagrams
* [kanban boards](/blog/kanban-boards.html)
* mobile mockups and app layouts
* infographics and diagrams for presentations
* [floor plans](/blog/floorplans.html)
* circuit layouts and [rack diagrams](/blog/rack-diagrams.html)
* [UML diagrams](/blog/uml-2-5.html) and relational schema
* cloud infrastructure diagrams and [threat models](/blog/threat-modelling.html)
* ...

The draw.io diagram editor is easy to use and powerful. The [draw.io app in Confluence Cloud is also secure and private](/blog/data-protection.html) - Your data stays in the browser while you are editing a diagram and is stored only in your Confluence Cloud instance when you use the draw.io app. 

* Attach unlimited diagrams to pages with the draw.io macros.
* Use and connect shapes from an extensive collection of shape libraries.
* Style shapes, connectors and text labels.
* Draw freehand shapes and create custom shapes.
* Use a template from the template library to start diagramming quickly.
* Switch to various editor styles, including a [simpler draw.io Board macro](/blog/drawio-board-macro.html), ideal for brainstorming.

## Unlock additional draw.io features for larger teams

If you have started a free trial in your team of more than 10 users and let the license expire, you would have noticed that the app continues to work, minus a few features.

When you [license the draw.io app for your larger Confluence Cloud instance](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1210933/draw-io-diagrams-for-confluence?hosting=cloud&tab=overview), you will continue to enjoy the features covered in the post above, in addition to the following:
