When you export your diagram to a PDF file, you can include a copy of your diagram data. When you drop that file onto the draw.io editor, it will open your diagram for editing again. 

**Tip:** You can [crop the PDF to match the size of the diagram](/doc/faq/pdf-export-crop.html), rather than using your devices page size settings.

1. Click _File > Export As > PDF_.

2. Change the export settings to suit your requirements.
   * Select whether to include _All Pages_ in your multi-page diagram, the _Current Page_ or just the shapes and connectors that are currently selected (_Selection Only_).
   * If you are printing the just the current page or a selection, enable the _Crop_ checkbox to crop the generated PDF to fit your diagram.
   * Enable the checkboxes if you want a _Transparent Background_, or to include the _Grid_ of the drawing canvas. 
   * Leave the checkbox enabled to _Include a copy of my diagram_ to include diagram data in your PDF file, so you can open it again in the draw.io editor.
