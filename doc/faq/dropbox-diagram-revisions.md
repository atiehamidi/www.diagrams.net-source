Dropbox and several other cloud platform providers support file version history. When draw.io auto-saves, a new version of your diagram is created.

1. [Open the diagram stored in Dropbox](/doc/faq/dropbox-diagram-open.html) in the draw.io editor.
2. Select _File > Revision History_ from the menu.
3. Preview the different versions of your diagram by clicking on the tabs on the left.
4. Click _Restore_ to restore an older version of your diagram.
