Many people prefer a minimal interface for diagramming, as there are fewer distractions. While online whiteboard applications often have a limited set of available tools, draw.io lets you use its advanced features in a [less cluttered diagram editor theme](/blog/sketch-online-whiteboard.html).

As the interface is simpler in our online editor at [sketch.diagrams.net](https://sketch.diagrams.net/), the advanced diagramming tools are in less obvious places.

<br />_To work with a dark background in the Sketch editor theme, select Settings > Appearance > Dark from the menu in the top left_

**Display and hide panels and floating dialogs**

Click on the arrows to the right of the title of panels and floating dialogs to expand or collapse them, or click on the cross to close them. Drag them around the drawing canvas to get them out of the way of your diagram.

* **Shapes:** Click on the _Shapes_ tool in the toolbar on the left.
* **Format:** Expand the panel on the right. 
* **Layers:** Click on the menu icon in the top left, then select _Layers_. 
* **Tags:** Click on the menu icon, then select _Tags_.
* **Freehand:** Click on the _Freehand_ tool in the toolbar on the left.

## Create multi-page diagrams

Multiple pages are useful when you need to drill down into details or explore alternatively solutions, but keep all the diagrams together in one file. You can also add links on shapes that open another diagram page when you click on them.

1. Click on the page name in the lower right. The pages in your diagram are in the second section, with the current one indicated with a check mark. 
* _Insert Page_ adds a new diagram page.
* _Duplicate ..._ makes a copy of the current diagram page.
* _Rename ..._ lets you rename the current diagram page.
* _Remove ..._ deletes the current diagram page.
* _Move_ lets you reorder the current diagram page.

## Set additional diagramming features

In the menu under preferences, you can enable or disable a number of features.
* **Appearance:** Switch between [dark and light mode](/blog/dark-mode-diagram-editor.html).
* **Theme:** Switch to another [diagram editor theme](/blog/diagram-editor-theme.html). This requires you to refresh the browser tab - make sure you save your diagram first.
* **Language:** [Change the language](/blog/translate-diagram.html) used in the editor.
* **Units:** Choose a measurement unit - points, inches, millimeters or meters.
* **Tooltips:** Enable or disable tooltips that appear when you hover over the tools in the editor.
* **Ruler:** Display or hide a ruler to the left and top of the diagram editor.
* **Configuration:** Set default styles for shapes, custom fonts, custom templates, custom shape libraries, and more. [Learn how to configure the diagram editor](/doc/faq/configure-diagram-editor.html)

Some options are available in the format panel on the right. Make sure nothing is selected in your diagram so you can see the _Diagram_ tab. 
* **Grid:** Display or hide the drawing canvas grid. Disabled by default. 
* **Page View:** Display the drawing canvas as a printable pages, or as an infinite canvas. Disabled by default. 
* **Background:** Change the background colour, set a background image, or [use one diagram page as a background image for other pages](/blog/background-pages-diagrams.html). You must enable _Preferences > Pages_ to use this feature. 
* **Connection Arrows, Connection Points & Guides:** Display or hide the features that appear when you hover over a shape, or move a shape near other shapes on the drawing canvas. 
* **Mathematical Typesetting:** Enter LaTeX or AsciiMath to render equations neatly using MathJax. [Learn more about using maths in diagrams](/blog/maths-in-diagrams.html)

## Do more with shapes

Right-click on a shape to open the context menu, then select _Edit_. From there, you can work with shapes in many different ways.

* **Crop** to re-crop an image shape.
* **Edit Data** to add custom properties (metadata) and placeholders to shapes.
* **Copy Data** to copy the shape metadata.
* **Edit Connection Points** to [modify the shape's fixed connection points](doc/faq/shape-connection-points-customise.html).
* **Edit Geometry** to specify an exact position, size or rotation.
* **Edit Tooltip** to define a tooltip that appears when you hover over the shape. 
* **Edit Style** to define a specific shape style with key-value pairs.

1. From the menu in the top left, select _File > Share_.
2. Choose the sharing option you want to use and make sure you have set the permissions appropriately - public lets you share a link to the diagram file with anyone.

## Work with complex tables

Create complex tables with table, row and column titles (such as cross-functional flowcharts) using the _Table_ tool (via the ``+`` in the toolbar on the left). 

When you have selected a table or a row, use the tools in the _Arrange_ tab of the format panel to add or remove columns and rows. Hover over any tool to see a descriptive tooltip.

Drop shapes and text into the table cells, then drag connectors between them to create complex flow charts.
