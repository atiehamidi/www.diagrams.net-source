Salesforce diagrams let you visualise your system and solution architectures using a set of icons (shapes) recommended by Salesforce.

Salesforce have developed a set of icons that can be used in marketing and sales strategy diagrams as well as process and infrastructure documentation.

**Open the Salesforce shape library in draw.io**

1. At the bottom of the shape panel, click on _More Shapes_. 
2. In the _Software_ category, make sure _Salesforce_ is selected and click _Apply_.

## Visualise systems in Salesforce diagrams
Salesforce documentation and implementation diagrams are tightly related to [C4 models](/blog/c4-modelling.html) in that they are separated into four levels of detail. 
* **Level 1:** An overview diagram visualises the entire system or solution (the _big picture_ or system overview as above) showing how the subsystems relate to each other. 
* **Level 2:** Visualises a subsystem or related set of systems that form one _piece of the whole_ solution.

* **Level 3:** This _process or interaction view_ shows only the systems involved and the big process steps in the diagram.

* **Level 4:** Specific process steps and detailed data structures are included in these '_double click_' diagrams.

**Tip:** These diagrams follow the [Salesforce Data Model Notation](https://architect.salesforce.com/diagrams/framework/data-model-notation), and usually include a diagram key, as well as a diagram title and short description. 

There is some overlap between level 3 and level 4 diagrams, as you can see in the example (open this in the draw.io viewer) - however, level 4 always has the highest level of detail of process steps or data structures.

## Add diagrams to Quip pages

Quip is a content and chat platform provided in and by Salesforce to support team projects and communication.

1. Create a diagram in our free online editor or Desktop app. 
2. Export the diagram to a PNG or SVG image and _Include the diagram data_. 
3. Add the image you just exported to the Quip page. 

If you or anyone else in your team need to update the diagram, drag and drop that image file from the Quip page back into the [draw.io online editor](https://app.diagram.net/) or our [Desktop app](https://get.diagrams.net/) to continue working with the diagram. When finished, export an updated image with the diagram data included and drop that image back into Quip. 

**Tip:** If you are using Atlassian Jira for project management alongside Quip, you may find it easier to [attach diagrams directly to their related Jira issues](/doc/drawio-jira-cloud.html) with our [draw.io for Jira app](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211413/draw-io-diagrams-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview).

## Many types of diagrams

Salesforce shapes are useful in many types of diagrams, including capability maps, business models, customer journey models, support overview charts, asset management diagrams, service and system [roadmaps](/blog/timeline-diagrams.html), and many more.

draw.io has many other infrastructure and business modelling shape libraries in the _Software_, _Networking_ and _Business_ categories, including up-to-date AWS, Azure and GCP libraries, as well as logos of common online and service platforms. 

You can [search for the logo or shape](/doc/faq/shape-search.html) in the shapes panel, or open one of the [publicly available custom draw.io shape libraries](/blog/public-custom-libraries.html).
