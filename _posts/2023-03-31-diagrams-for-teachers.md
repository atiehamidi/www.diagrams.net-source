Diagrams are an effective way of teaching and learning because we all understand complex information more easily when it is visualised. Graphic organisers, mindmaps, timelines, cause and effect charts, Venn diagrams, flowcharts, scientific illustrations - all of these can created in diagrams.net.

With its vast shape libraries, teachers can create a wide range of diagram resources for their students and prepare handouts quickly, and students can take visual notes and draw the diagrams they need for assessment tasks.


## Many types of diagrams support learning

**Graphic organisers and thinking maps** are diagrams that show connections and relationships between topics, terms, events, ideas and facts. Most types of diagrams fall into these superclasses, including the simple concept map below.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/concept-map.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="A concept map using shapes from the General shape library in diagrams.net">

**Mindmaps** are similar to concept maps, and often used to brainstorm topics or ideas prior to a writing task or discussion. They can also be used to improve reading comprehension when analysing texts.

**Persuasion diagrams** help you to write persuasive essays and prepare for debates. Start with a claim or what you want to convince the reader of, note two or three main reasons to support that claim, add supporting facts or examples for each of the reasons, and end with a conclusion. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/persuasion-map-example.png" style="width=100%;max-width:200px;height:auto;" alt="Organise an essay with a persuasion diagram">

**Sequences and timelines** are necessary in history classes or when discussing any [sequence of events or roadmap](/blog/timeline-diagrams.html). 
<br />[<img src="/assets/img/blog/timeline-infographic-shapes-horizontal.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Use the horizontal roadmap shapes from the Infographic shape library in diagrams.net">](https://app.diagrams.net/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fjgraph%2Fdrawio-diagrams%2Fdev%2Fexamples%2Ftimeline-infographic-shapes-horizontal.drawio)

**KWL charts** are popular tools both for school and in the workplace for professional development. They visually organise text and goals into three columns: current ``K``nowledge, what you ``W``ant to know, and what you will have ``L``earned afterwards. 
  
This chart can be extended with additional columns as needed, such as topics for ``F``urther exploration, or notes about ``H``ow you will gain the information you need.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/kwl-example.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="KWL charts are commonly used in all levels of education, both as a class target and for individual studies">

**Tip:** Use list shapes to enter text quickly, or the pool shapes in the Advanced shape library (as in the example), into which you can drop text and other shapes.

**Cause and effect** or [fishbone diagrams](/blog/ishikawa-diagrams.html) are used extensively in industry as well as at school. It's a a popular type of diagram to explore problems, their potential causes and brainstorm solutions. 
<br />[<img src="/assets/img/blog/ishikawa-example-manufacturing.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="An example of an manufacturing Ishikawa diagram for a defective part">](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fjgraph%2Fdrawio-diagrams%2Fmaster%2Fblog%2Fishikawa-diagram-examples.drawio)
  

**Venn diagrams and bubble maps** are used to compare and contrast two or more categories. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/venn-vs-bubble.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Venn diagrams are better when showing fewer similarities and differences than bubble maps">

**Cluster diagrams** group information together into related clusters, and contrast them with other clusters in the diagram. These types of diagrams are used extensively in the workplace too: [network diagrams](/blog/network-diagrams.html), system context diagrams, size comparisons, [UML diagrams](/search?search=UML), relationship graphs, and more. 
[<img src="/assets/img/blog/template-living_beings_mind_map.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Mindmap of living beings - a template in diagrams.net">](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fjgraph%2Fdrawio-diagrams%2Fdev%2Ftemplates%2Fmaps%2Fliving_beings_mind_map.xml)

The **four square writing method** is often used to teach writing skills to younger children to help them formulate and order ideas before writing an essay. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/four-square-writing-method.png" style="width=100%;max-width:250px;height:auto;" alt="The four square writing method is a good way to help structure paragraphs for essays">
  

**Flowcharts** are probably the most common type of diagram, both at school and at work. They are used to visualise all types of processes. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/flowchart-music-practice.png" style="width=100%;max-width:500px;height:auto;" alt="Flowcharts are useful in so many different ways">


<br />
## Graphic recording or visual note taking

Also called sketch notes, these are often used to prepare attractive doodled summaries of presentations and workshops. As they are a good way to maintain attention, encourage critical thinking, and remember the information that was presented, encourage students to doodle their notes so they can learn better.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/sketch-notes.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Taking notes graphically helps with understanding and remembering the information more clearly">

Using the [freehand brush](/doc/faq/insert-freehand-shapes.html) and diagrams.net on a tablet, you can doodle easily - even quite complex shapes like the crow below. 
<br />[<img src="/assets/img/blog/freehand-crow.png" style="width=100%;max-width:250px;height:auto;" alt="Freehand drawing in diagrams.net on a tablet - click the freehand tool in the toolbar on the left">](/blog/freehand-drawing.html)

**Tip:** [Multiple students can work on the same visual notes](/blog/real-time-collaboration-diagrams.html) and see each others' cursors in real time, if they store the diagram file in Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive - great for group work.

<br />
## Infographics and handouts

Most often used as posters or slides, infographics combine multiple diagrams and visual elements to explain different aspects of a more complex topic. The infographic shape library in diagrams.net contains many templates such as those used below.
<br />[<img src="/assets/img/blog/infographic-example.png" style="width=100%;max-width:300px;;height:auto;" alt="You can create attractive infographics in diagrams.net">](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fjgraph%2Fdrawio-diagrams%2Fdev%2Fexamples%2FInfographic.xml)

**Need more shapes?** Here's how to [search for icons and shapes](/doc/faq/shape-search.html).

Handouts are easy and fast to prepare in diagrams.net. You can [export a diagram to a PDF file](/doc/faq/export-to-pdf.html), or [export it to an image file](/doc/faq/export-to-png.html) that you can then import into a document. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/handout-example.png" style="width=100%;max-width:500px;height:auto;" alt="It's faster to prepare attractive handouts in diagrams.net than in word processing applications">


<br />
## Scientific illustrations

You can create almost any type of illustration in diagrams.net, either without or on top of an image. 

For example, this [labelled diagram](/blog/label-any-diagram.html) was created with bracket shapes, connectors and text over the background image of a horse. 
<br />[<img src="/assets/img/blog/labels-example-horse.png" style="width=100%;max-width:300px;height:auto;" alt="Label any diagram with bracket shapes and connectors">](https://app.diagrams.net/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fjgraph%2Fdrawio-diagrams%2Fdev%2Fblog%2Fhorse-labelled.drawio)

This prism illustration was created with basic shapes, connectors and text from the default shape libraries. 
<br />[<img src="/assets/img/blog/labels-example-prism.png" style="width=100%;max-width:300px;height:auto;" alt="Use arc shapes to label angles">](https://app.diagrams.net/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fjgraph%2Fdrawio-diagrams%2Fdev%2Fblog%2Flight-spectrum.drawio)

These [structural formulas for chemistry classes](/blog/draw-structural-formulas.html) use shapes from the Arrows shape library.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/chemistry-projection-notations1.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Draw a 3D representation of a chemical in diagrams.net using various projection notations">

Many people have made [custom shape libraries](/blog/public-custom-libraries.html) available on the web, like the [Bioicons](/blog/biochem-clipart-in-diagrams.html) used below, that will help you draw diagrams for handouts and assignments.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/integrations-bioicons-example.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Bioicons can be used to create a wide range of illustrations with diagrams.net">
