You can [create network diagrams](/blog/network-diagrams.html) from scratch in draw.io using shapes that match the platform you are using - AWS, GCP, Veeam, Azure, Cisco, IBM and many more. Both the draw.io AWS19 and GCP Icon shape libraries for network and cloud architectures have been updated recently. 

## Open the updated network shape libraries

Both the Amazon Web Service and Google Cloud Platform shape libraries have been updated recently. Enable the shape libraries that you need to use in draw.io.

1. Click on _More Shapes_ in the left-hand panel. 
2. In the _Networking_ section, click on the checkboxes next to the libraries you want to enable, then click _Apply_.

If you want to see the shape names even when you aren't hovering over a shape in the shape libraries, click on the _Labels_ checkbox in the shape library selection dialog.

Hover over any shape in the shape libraries on the left of the drawing canvas to see a preview and its name.

Drag the shape library panel edge towards the drawing canvas to expand the panel and see more shapes.

## Updated AWS19 network shapes

Enabling the _AWS19_ shape library will give you a large number of sub-libraries in the left panel, sorted into logical categories. Expand the categories that you need by clicking on the sub-library's title or the arrow next to it.

As you can see below, the AWS19 shape library for modelling cloud service architectures on Amazon's platform is large and varied.

## Updated GCP Icons

The large _Google Cloud Platform_ shape library containers older labels and icons, whereas the updated _GCP Icons_ are sorted into their own shape library. Click _More Shapes_ and enable the _GCP Icons_ library to see updated sub-libraries shown below.

Some cloud visualisation platforms can output diagrams in the ``.drawio`` format, including [Cloudcraft](/blog/drawio-aws-cloudcraft.html) and [Cloudockit](/blog/cloudockit-to-drawio.html). 

Embed the exported diagram in your system documentation or display it in your wiki with one of our [draw.io integrations](/integrations.html).

**Network diagram templates**

draw.io includes many templates for common cloud infrastructures on several platforms. Select _Arrange > Insert > Template_ from the menu.
