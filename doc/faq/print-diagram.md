**Pages**

This option is not shown if your diagram has only one page.

* If your [diagram has multiple pages](/blog/multiple-page-diagrams.html), select _Print all pages_.
* Alternatively, type the page range you want to print in _Pages_. Each diagram page will be printed on a separate page.

**Zoom**

* By default, your diagram will be printed at **100%** - to fit to your page. Change the _Adjust to_ field to another percentage if you want to make your diagram smaller, or larger and printed across multiple pages.
* Or, select _Fit to_ and enter the number of sheets (pages) you want your diagram to be printed _across_ and _down_.

**Paper**

* If you want a different _Paper Size_, select one from the drop-down list.
* If your diagram is wider than it is high, you may find it prints better on _Landscape_ instead of _Portrait_. Make sure you also change your printer settings to match.
* If you have set a different page scale in your system's printer settings, change the _Page Scale_ here to match.


**Tip:** You can also [print your diagram to a PDF file](/doc/faq/pdf-print-to.html) instead of exporting it.

If you want to only print part of a diagram, you'll need to select and copy that part onto a new diagram page, and print just that page.
