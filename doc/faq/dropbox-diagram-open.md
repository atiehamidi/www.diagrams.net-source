Make sure you have logged into your Dropbox account and [authorised the draw.io editor](/doc/faq/dropbox-diagrams-store.html) to store and edit diagrams stored there.

1. Go to [our online editor](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=dropbox) and click _Open Existing Diagram_. If you are already in the diagram editor and using Dropbox to store your diagrams, select _File > Open_ from the menu.
2. Navigate to the diagram file in your Dropbox folders, select it, then click _Choose_ to open it in the draw.io editor.

**Note:** If you have stored a diagram file outside of the _app>drawio_ folder, draw.io will copy it on an automatic save. This is because Dropbox only allows draw.io to store data in this specific folder.

You don't need to manually save your diagram after you make changes to it - draw.io will save a new version of your diagram regularly while you are editing.
