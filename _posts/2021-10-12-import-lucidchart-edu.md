Lucidchart recently limited their free education plans, Lucidchart EDU, for students and teachers to only 3 editable diagrams. That means that all of the diagrams after your most recent three diagram files are set to read only, unless you switch to a premium subscription. 

Individual licenses for educational apps can be quite expensive. This is especially hard for parents with multiple children in distance learning, or educators who are provided with a limited selection of remote tools.

You can create and edit an unlimited number of diagrams for free with draw.io, both in our [online app](https://app.diagrams.net) and with draw.io Desktop.

Because draw.io works on a [bring-your-own-storage model](/blog/secure-diagramming-storage.html), your files are not locked behind a paywall. You can choose to store your files in many different cloud storage locations (Google Drive, OneDrive, GitHub, ... ), in your browser, or on your local computer. You are free to view, edit, publish and share them at any time. 

**Tip:** [draw.io also integrates well with Google Classroom](/blog/google-classroom-diagrams.html). See below for more details.

## How to import Lucidchart diagrams

By using the free draw.io Importer extension for the Google Chrome browser, you can convert all of your Lucidchart diagrams to draw.io in a couple of steps. 

1. Install the [draw.io Importer extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/diagramsnet-and-drawio-im/cnoplimhpndhhhnmoigbanpjeghjpohi) in Google Chrome.
2. Log into your Lucidchart account in one tab. 
3. Open another tab and go to [app.diagrams.net/tools/lucid/import.html](https://app.diagrams.net/tools/lucid/import.html)
4. Click on a diagram file to see a preview and select or deselect it, or click _Select all_ to select everything, then click _Import_.

All of the selected diagrams will be converted and saved in a ``.zip`` file in your default downloads folder. Expand this ZIP file to access all of the diagrams, now in the ``.drawio`` format. 

* Drag a ``.drawio`` diagram file into a new diagram in the online editor at app.diagrams.net or select _File > Import from_ in the menu then select your file to open it.

* If you have installed the [draw.io Desktop](https://get.diagrams.net/), double click on any ``.drawio`` file to open it in the desktop application.
