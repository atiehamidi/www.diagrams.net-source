You can customise the diagrams.net editor and choose your preferred theme for the user interface. The UI theme controls which editor elements are displayed, minimised or hidden, including the menu, toolbar, panels and dialog boxes.

There are four different themes to choose from, with a fifth currently under development.

**Change the editor theme via the diagrams.net menu**

1. Select _File > Extras_ in the diagrams.net menu. 
2. Choose Default (Kennedy), Minimal, Atlas, Dark, or Sketch (a whiteboard-style theme).
3. Reload the diagrams.net editor to start using your selected editor theme. 

_Please visit GitHub to [leave feedback about the Sketch and Minimal editor themes](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/discussions/1924) and help guide their development._

**Tip:** If you are new to diagramming, read the [introduction to the diagrams.net editor](/doc/getting-started-editor.html) that looks at all the various important elements.

## Default 

The default editor theme (previously the Kennedy theme), named after the Google UI, is the default style for diagrams.net, and shows the menu, toolbar, file name, language selector, fixed panels either side and diagram pages below the drawing canvas.

## Atlas

If you are used to using the draw.io apps on Atlassian Confluence or Jira, and would prefer to keep using that interface at diagrams.net. 

The Atlas UI theme does not show the diagram's filename or the _Share_ button, but the rest of the editor elements are displayed in roughly the same positions.

## Dark 

If you prefer to work on a dark background with light outlines and text, or if you are creating an infographic that will be printed on a dark background, the Dark UI theme is for you - it's a mostly inverted version of the default Kennedy theme.

**When using the Dark theme**
* **Sharing diagrams:** You may need to change the text label and shape/connector colours to be readable if you plan to share your diagrams with colleagues who use a light UI theme. 
* **Exporting diagrams:** Also, make sure you set the background of your diagram to transparent before you export it to a PDF or image format, or it will have a black background.

## Minimal 

If you are diagramming on a tablet or a mobile device, the Minimal theme allows you to collapse the panels around the drawing canvas for less 'clutter'. The Minimal theme, or the Sketch (whiteboard) editor theme below are ideal for [remote kanban boards](/blog/kanban-boards.html)

**When using the Minimal theme**
* The menu is minimised to the _Diagram_ tool on the toolbar, panels can be toggled on and off as you need, or minimised to their titles to make room for more drawing. 
* The panels are floating in the Minimal theme, you can drag them to a new position over the drawing canvas.
* Select _Diagram > Preferences > Theme_ when using the Minimal editor theme to change to another one, then refresh the page.

If you are new to diagramming and feel overwhelmed with the number of tools displayed in a diagram editor, you may find the Minimal theme easier to use.

## Sketch 

If you prefer minimal tools and the rough style enabled by default, like you would in a whiteboarding app, the Sketch editor theme is for you. This easy-to-use theme is set by default in the [draw.io Board macro](/blog/drawio-board-macro.html) for Confluence, and in the [draw.io for Notion Chrome extension](/blog/store-diagrams-notion.html).

The Sketch editor theme may also be useful to introduce younger children to diagramming or support them as they [add diagrams to their documents and in Google Classroom](/blog/google-classroom-diagrams.html) with the Google Drive add-in.

Enable the [Sketch editor theme](/blog/sketch-online-whiteboard.html) as you would any other theme and refresh the page. Alternatively, go to [sketch.diagrams.net](http://sketch.diagrams.net)
