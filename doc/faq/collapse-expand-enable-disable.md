You can collapse and expand (or fold) container shapes, available in the _Advanced_ shape library. This behaviour is enabled by default, but may be disabled via the draw.io menu.

* Select _Extras > Collapse/Expand_ in the menu. The check mark next to this menu item indicates whether it is enabled (check) or disabled (blank).

**Minimal theme:** Right click, then select _Options > Collapse/Expand_.

To turn any shape into a container, select it, then press ``Ctrl+G`` on Windows, or ``Cmd+G`` on macOS.
