After you have [inserted an image](/doc/faq/add-images.html) into your diagram, you can crop it (clip it) in various shapes.

1. Right click on an image on the drawing canvas and select _Crop_.
2. Resize the rectangular crop using the grab handles. 
3. Drag the crop box to move it to another area of the image. 
4. Change the shape of the crop:
   * _Ellipse_ sets a circular or ellipse-shaped crop.
   * _Rounded_ rounds the corners on the rectangular crop.
5. Click on _Apply_

<img src="/assets/img/blog/crop.gif" style="width=100%;max-width:600px;height:auto;" alt="Crop an embedded or imported image in diagrams.net and draw.io">

This is a non-destructive crop. To reset the crop to the original image, click on _Reset_ in the crop image dialog.
