## Use the draw.io editor

Your diagram will be opened in the draw.io editor. You can now edit, expand and style your diagram as you need.

* Add or replace shapes using the shape libraries on the left.
* [Select one or more shapes or connectors](/faq/doc/select-multiple-shapes.html) then change their style using the format panel on the right.
* Use the toolbar above the drawing canvas to change the zoom and work with details, undo or redo changes, move shapes forwards or backwards, work with styles, change connectors, and more.
* Reroute connectors by dragging them to [add extra waypoints](/blog/waypoints-connectors.html).
* Click on the ``+`` at the bottom of the drawing canvas to [add an extra page to your diagram file](/blog/multiple-page-diagrams.html).
