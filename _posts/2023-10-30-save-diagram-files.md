As draw.io does not store your diagram data, you need to select a location to store your diagram files. With an increasing number of cloud storage and Git platforms, as well as your browser and local device, we've streamlined the location selection to a drop down list.

When you have saved your diagram once to a cloud platform or directly in your browser, draw.io will autosave the file whenever you edit your diagram. This adds a new version to the [revision history in Google Drive](/doc/faq/google-drive-revision-history.html), if you have selected this location.

**Tip:** Typically, draw.io will remember the cloud storage folder where you last stored a diagram file and use that location for a new diagram file. 

To choose a different location on that platform, select any of the options with _Pick a folder_.



## Choose a location for your diagram files

With draw.io, your diagram files aren't locked behind any account - choose whichever file storage location suits you best. 

1. In the draw.io menu, select _File > Save As_, or press ``Ctrl+Shift+S`` (``Cmd+Shift+S`` on macOS), or click on the _Unsaved changes_ notification in the toolbar.

2. Enter a name for your diagram file.

3. Choose the [file format](/doc/faq/save-file-formats.html) (_Type_) you wish to save your diagram as as - by default it will use the ``.drawio`` extension and XML format. All of these formats will contain your diagram data so they can be re-opened in the draw.io editor.

<br />You may need to authorise draw.io so that it can save the diagram file into your selected cloud storage account. See how to authorise draw.io to use the following platforms: 
   * [Google Drive and Google Workspace](/doc/faq/google-drive-diagrams.html)
   * [Microsoft OneDrive](/doc/faq/microsoft-one-drive-authorisation.html)
   * [GitHub](/blog/github-support.html)
   * [GitLab](/blog/gitlab-support.html)
   * [DropBox](/doc/faq/dropbox-diagrams-store.html)
5. Click _OK_ to save the file, if it hasn't already saved during the Authorisation process.

## Save or export your diagram?

Save your diagram to **include the diagram data**.

You can use a .drawio XML file, PNG or SVG image, or a HTML file and your [diagram data will be saved within that file](/blog/diagram-data-image-formats.html) so you can open it again in the draw.io editor and continue diagramming. 

Export your diagram **with or without** embedding the diagram data.

The [export file formats](/doc/faq/export-diagram.html) _can_ contain the diagram data, if you use a compatible format, but you can disable this option. This is useful when you want to share your diagram, but not allow the recipient to open a copy and edit it.

When you export to a pure image file (PNG, JPEG, SVG, WebP), or PDF file, your diagram will be displayed as a single image shape if re-opened in the draw.io editor.
