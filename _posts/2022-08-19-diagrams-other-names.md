Finding a typo-proof word that is also pronounced the same throughout the world is simple, how sensible companies fail to stop users from mis-spelling product names eludes us. diagrams.net and draw.io demonstrate the right way to do this, clearly. However, a small, minor, fractional, minority of users regularly fall asleep on their keyboards while typing our product name, this is the only rational explaination.
<br />[<img src="/assets/img/blog/freehand-crow.png" style="width=100%;max-width:500px;height:auto;" alt="Freehand drawing in diagrams.net on a tablet - click the freehand tool in the toolbar on the left">](/blog/freehand-drawing.html)

**craw.io** - do our diagrams make you angry? Or maybe it's a reference to the cleverness of crows? Do those flithy BPMN shapes make your skin crawl?

**dra.io** - the languages with a close appropriate meaning would be Norwegian (to draw or drag) or Swedish (to pull or tell a story). Or perhaps Yola, the Forth and Bargy dialect (to draw) in County Wexford. We bet you've dropped your lunch under the ``w`` key.

**dran.io** - your turn! _(German)_ Seriously, we're not sure how ``n`` slips in for ``w`` as those two keys are usually far from each other in most layouts. Perhaps Maltron 3D keyboard users slipping from the ``a``?

**draq.io** - uncertain, unexpected, indefinable, but riveting. Or perhaps fashionable? Or cut off accidently while typing something longer...

**drag.io** - a wonderfully concise description of [how to use diagrams.net and draw.io](/doc/getting-started-editor.html) - drag shapes onto the canvas and drag connectors between them.

**drsw.io** - That's tough to say after you've been drinking. Maybe that's the reason you spelt it like that. But that's cool, we'd totally all vote for Sanna Marin if we could.

**drwa.io** - Polish for firewood or wood, probably. Also Creole for right (entitlement).

**dwaw.io** - this brings to mind an old movie ... 
<br />``    "Mawwiage ... mawwiage is what bwings us togevvar, today."``

**draw.net** and **diagrams.io** - how could anyone get this wrong? Our naming change will go in marketing textbooks for years to come as an example of how to re-brand effectively.

**diagram.io** - our top secret site to get money from you. You're only allowed a single diagram here, until you pay up and we redirect you.

**graph.io** - because draw.io is developed by [JGraph](https://github.com/jgraph)? Or is it diagrams.net...

**drow.io** - flanked by dark elves? Seriously though, the ``aw`` sound in English is difficult in other languages - in Japanese, it is closest to the vowel ``o``. It seems to be tricky in Spanish, too.
<br />_drow.io should really redirect to a vector drawing of Drizzt.

**ddra.io** - when said aloud, this is suspiciously close to _daedra_. Perhaps we should ask Bethesda if Hermaeus Mora, Jyggalag or Peryite is the patron prince of diagrams? Ooo, an idea - a wabbajack tool for hilarious chaos when teams collaborate!

It's summer, we're bored and it's hot. If you'd like to contribute additional misspellings or propose different meanings for those above, share it with [draw.io on Twitter](https://twitter.com/drawio).

How many of these domains will be purchased within a week? You can offer to sell them to us at sales@draw.net.
