diagrams.net is a versatile application that can be used offline in a number of ways - as a stand-alone desktop application, as a progressive web application (PWA), or as a Chrome web app.

## Use diagrams.net desktop

## Use diagrams.net offline as a progressive web app

When you go to app.diagrams.net in your web browser on your computer or mobile device, and load a diagram, you can continue working on it even if you disconnect from the internet.

As app.diagrams.net runs as a [progressive web app (PWA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/progressive_web_application), after the editor and your diagram have been loaded via your internet connection, you can safely disconnect from the internet and continue to work on the diagram.

Depending on where you you have chosen to save your diagram, you may need to reconnect before closing that browser tab.

**Note:** The following features are not available without an internet connection.

- Load, save or export diagrams to cloud storage platforms, or autosave your diagram.
- Convert diagrams to PDF and image file formats.
- Create a new diagram from a template or insert a template diagram.
- Search for and use the online clipart shapes.
- Insert from PlantUML to auto-generate a UML diagram, or use [mathematical typesetting](/doc/faq/math-typesetting.html).
- Use fonts such as Google fonts and ``*.woff`` files that are hosted online.
- Use the [online help](/doc/faq/help-menu.html).

## Use the diagrams.net Chrome app offline
