By default, draw.io uses an A4 paper size in a portrait orientation. You can change the paper size and the orientation via the _Format_ panel or the menu. 

## Use the format panel to change the paper size

1. Make sure you have nothing selected in your diagram so you can see the _Paper Size_ settings in the format panel on the right. 
2. Select a new _Paper Size_ from the drop down list.
3. Click on either _Portrait_ or _Landscape_ to change the page orientation.

**Tip:** If your drawing canvas does not indicate the page edges, make sure the _Page View_ checkbox is enabled in the _Diagram_ tab on the format panel.

### Change the page setup

1. Select _File > Page Setup_.

2. Select _Custom_ from the _Paper Size_ list.
3. Enter the custom height and width of your page in inches.
