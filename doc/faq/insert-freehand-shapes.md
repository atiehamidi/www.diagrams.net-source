1. Select _Arrange > Insert > Freehand_ to open the _Freehand_ dialog. 
<br />If you are using the [Sketch whiteboard-like editor theme](/blog/sketch-online-whiteboard.html), click on the _Freehand_ tool (pen icon).
2. Draw your shape with your mouse (hold the left-mouse button down to draw), then click _Stop drawing_ to convert it to an image with a transparent background. 

To create a freehand shape with a thicker line, enable the _Brush_ checkbox and increase the slider width, then draw your freehand shape.
