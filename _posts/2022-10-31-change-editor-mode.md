With draw.io, you can switch [editor themes](/blog/diagram-editor-theme.html) via the menu - Default, Minimal, Sketch (whiteboard) and Atlas. There are also editor **modes** to switch between the classic mode - the default editor layout or theme you've selected via the menu - and the new simple mode. This toggle switch lets you swap between dark and light modes quickly.

**Note:** If you are in light mode, the icon in the top right will be a sun. If you are in dark mode, it will be a moon. 

## Switch between modes in draw.io

1. Click on the sun/moon icon in the top right.

1. Deselect _Simple_ to switch to the new _Simple_ mode. You don't need to reload your browser tab. Click on it again to switch back to your previous editor theme.
2. Click on _Dark_ to switch to dark mode in whatever editor theme you are using. Click on "Light" to use light mode. 

**Tip:** _Automatic_ should reflect your operating system or browser settings automatically (when they are set to dark mode).

<br />
### Dark mode works on all editor themes

When you switch into dark mode, the editor will automatically switch some colours of shapes and text so they are more readable.

**Tip:** Many diagrams in the template diagram also work well in dark mode - click on the magnifying glass in the top right of a diagram in the [template library](/blog/template-diagrams.html) to see a preview.

### Introducing simple mode

With the new simple mode, we have redesigned toolbar and integrated the menu so the editor is sleeker and less distracting.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/simple-mode-toolbar.png" style="width=100%;max-width:600px;height:auto;" alt="The draw.io simple mode has a simpler toolbar which integrates the menu">

* Click on ``...`` (three dots) at the right end of the toolbar to open the settings and import/export menu. 

* Hide or display the format panel via _Format_ at the right end of the toolbar next to the mode switch. 

* Hide or display the shapes, layers, tags panel and other tools via _View_ at the left end of the toolbar.

* Use the tools in the middle to add shapes, text, freehand drawings and tables, as you would from the normal toolbar. 

* Click on the ``+`` in the middle to insert specific shapes, images, templates, or use the advanced text-to-diagram tools.

**Tip:** Hover over any of the tools or text to see a tooltip.

**Simplify the drawing canvas**
1. Make sure nothing is selected in your diagram so you can see the _Diagram_ tab in the format panel on the right. 
2. Disable the [_Grid_](/doc/faq/editor-grid-change.html) and [_Page View_](/doc/faq/editor-page-view.html) checkboxes.
