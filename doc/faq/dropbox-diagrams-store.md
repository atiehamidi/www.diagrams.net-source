Dropbox is a popular cloud platform for storing and sharing files. You can use your Dropbox cloud account to store your diagram files.

Dropbox limits third-party apps like draw.io to only storing files below the _app_ folder, [which are not shareable](/doc/faq/share-diagram-dropbox.html), which may limit collaboration, but is still useful when you need to diagram across multiple computers and share a diagram storage location.

## Disconnect draw.io from Dropbox

If you no longer want to store or access your diagrams in Dropbox, you can revoke the authorisation.

1. In Dropbox, click on your profile, then on _Settings_.
2. Click on the _Connected apps_ tab, expand the draw.io entry, then click _Disconnect_. This does not delete your diagram files, it only revokes the permissions to use Dropbox with draw.io.
