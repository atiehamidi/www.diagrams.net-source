draw.io can use a number of different locations to store your diagram files, including your local device and several cloud storage locations: Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, GitHub and GitLab.

1. Go to [the online version of draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net).
2. Select the location or online platform where you want to save your diagrams.

3. If you select a cloud storage location, you may be prompted to authorise the editor and grant it permission to read and edit files stored on that platform.

draw.io will automatically remember where you have last stored your diagram files. If you used your browser, it will automatically open your most recent diagram.
