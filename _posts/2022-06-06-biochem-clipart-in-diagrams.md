Bioicons is a collection of free custom shape libraries containing open source icons for life science applications. The website lets you [select one or more shape libraries](https://bioicons.com/extensions), and open them in the diagrams.net editor on the web. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/integrations-bioicons-example.png" style="width=100%;max-width:500px;height:auto;" alt="Bioicons can be used to create a wide range of illustrations with diagrams.net"> 

Bioicons is developed by Simon Duerr as an [open source project on Github](https://github.com/duerrsimon/bioicons). 

With these icons, you can create scientific illustrations, educational content, lifecycle diagrams, infographics, informative flyers, and more.

**Open source supports extensions and integrations**

Our open source [jgraph/drawio repository on Github](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) has encouraged many third-party integrations, in addition to our own draw.io apps and extensions for Atlassian software, Notion, Google Workplace, and Microsoft Office.

[See the range of diagrams.net/draw.io integrations](https://www.diagrams.net/integrations/)

## Use the Bioicons libraries in a diagram

1. Go to the Bioicons extension page at [https://bioicons.com/extensions](https://bioicons.com/extensions)
2. Select the libraries that you want to use.

3. Click _Launch draw.io_.

After a short loading time, the icon libraries you selected will be displayed in the left panel above the built-in diagrams.net shape libraries. 

Hover over any shape in these libraries to see a larger preview, including the icon's title and license information.

**Note:** Because the Bioicons are served, the _Search Shapes_ feature won't list results from these libraries.

## Tips for creating illustrations and infographics in diagrams.net

[Export to a wide range of formats](/doc/faq/export-diagram.html) including SVG and PNG images which you can embed in websites or documents. 

[Change the page scale](/doc/faq/page-scale.html) to resize your diagram quickly for printing.

Store the diagram file in Google Drive or One Drive, and embed your illustration in [Google Docs](/doc/faq/google-docs-diagrams.html) or in [Microsoft Word/Powerpoint](/doc/faq/microsoft-office-diagrams.html). Teachers and students can [share diagrams easily in Google Classroom](/blog/google-classroom-diagrams.html).

Search for additional clipart and icons at the top of the left panel - diagrams.net has a huge library of shapes and clipart.

Drag your favourite or oft-used icons from the drawing canvas into the [scratchpad](/doc/faq/scratchpad.html) on the left. 

Enable the _Infographics_ shape library to use [timelines](/blog/timeline-diagrams.html) and [circular flowcharts](/blog/circular-flowcharts.html). Enable the _Arrows_ for a variety of arrow shapes. 
* Click _More Shapes_ at the bottom of the left panel to enable or disable the diagrams.net shape libraries.

Change the [connector styles](/doc/faq/connector-styles.html) and [shape styles](/doc/faq/shape-styles.html) to match the Bioicons in your diagram using the _Style_ tab in the format panel on the right. You can also add gradients on arrow shapes for clear visual explanations. 

For a hand-drawn informal look, enable the _Sketch_ style.
