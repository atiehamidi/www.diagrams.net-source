title: New draw.io Board macro for whiteboard-style diagrams in Confluence Cloud
tags: [features, Atlassian]

Embed whiteboard-style diagrams in Confluence Cloud pages with the new draw.io Board macro. The Board macro is a new feature for our integration with Confluence Cloud, delivered as part of our draw.io brand.

When you add or edit a diagram using the **draw.io Board macro**, it uses the [Sketch editor theme](/blog/diagram-editor-theme.html), with the rough [sketch shape and connector styles](/blog/rough-style.html) set as the default global style. The diagram editor has a a white non-paginated background and no grid lines so it feels more like a whiteboard. 

A [discussion thread on the GitHub draw.io project](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/discussions/2056) is open if you have any questions or suggestions.

## Add the draw.io Board macro to a Confluence Cloud page

1. Edit the page and type ``/draw`` to see a list of macros you can embed.
2. Select the _draw.io Board_ macro from the list to open the diagram editor.

## Diagram in Confluence Cloud using the draw.io Board macro

The draw.io Board macro uses a simplified editor theme, where the diagramming tools are reduced to the essentials. The panels you are used to seeing in draw.io are minimised to make it feel more like a whiteboard. 

You can display panels and use the menus at any time to use the full functionality of the draw.io editor in the draw.io Board macro.

**Zoom:** To zoom in and out, click on the magnifying glass tools in the bottom right. Click on the number in the center to reset the zoom to 100%.

**Dark mode:** To switch between the default light theme and a dark theme (dark background and interface), click on the moon/sun tool in the bottom right.

**Tip:** Use the _Style_ tools in the format panel on the right to change your freehand shape's style, just as you would a shape from the shape libraries.

You will return to the Confluence page and see a preview of your diagram in the draw.io Board macro. 

Finally, publish your Confluence page.

## Change the draw.io Board macro viewer settings

There are two methods to change how your diagram appears to viewers:

When viewing the Confluence page, hover over the diagram, click on the gear icon in the toolbar, change the viewer settings then click _Save_.

<br />**Note:** If the diagram uses the _Simple Viewer_, you will not see the toolbar

Alternatively, from within the draw.io diagram editor, make sure nothing in your diagram is selected, then open the _Format_ panel. The _Viewer_ options are available at the top of the _Diagram_ tab of the format panel.
