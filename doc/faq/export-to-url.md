You can export your diagram data as a specially formatted URL. When someone clicks on this link, it opens a new copy of the diagram either in the draw.io viewer or editor, depending on the export options you selected. 

**Note:** Your diagram is not stored as a file when exporting to a URL - the data is purely encoded in the link, and that link is always valid. Once you have shared that link with someone, you can't revoke access, unlike access to a diagram file on a cloud storage platform.

Very large diagrams may not be able to be loaded from a overly long URL as browsers have varying limits on the length of URLs they can load. If you find this happens, use Google Drive to store your diagram - when you [publish a diagram publicly from Google Drive](/doc/faq/google-drive-publicly-publish-diagram.html), the URL will be shorter and neater.

1. Select _File > Export as > URL_.

2. Change the export settings to suit your requirements, then click _Create_.
   * By default _Links_ will open following the viewer's browser preferences. Select a different behaviour if you want links  to always open in a new tab or a new browser window. If you want, set a different link colour.
   * Deselect _All Pages_ if you only want to include the current page of your diagram.
   * To open your diagram directly in the draw.io editor, deselect the _Lightbox_ checkbox. 
   * By default, viewers can edit a copy of the diagram from the draw.io lightbox - change the behaviour or deselect the _Edit_ checkbox.
   * Deselect the _Layers_ checkbox if you don't want viewers to interact with the layers in your diagram.

3. _Copy_ the URL to share it by email or chat, or click on the Facebook button to add the link to a new post in a new browser tab. Click on _Preview_ to open the link in a new tab. Click _Close_ to return to the diagram editor.
