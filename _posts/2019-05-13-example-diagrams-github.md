We regularly publish new example diagrams in the [jgraph/drawio-diagrams](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-diagrams) repository on GitHub so they are easy to access. In this repository you'll find diagram examples that are used in:

* blog posts and FAQ answers
* the [example gallery on our website](/example-diagrams.html)
* training courses
* feature and plugin demonstrations
* draw.io template library

## Open a diagram as a template

If you find an example diagram that you want to use as a template in your diagram, click _Arrange > Insert > Template_.  

<img src="/assets/img/blog/arrange-insert-from-template-menu.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" alt="Insert a template diagram">

In the template library dialog, click on _From Template URL_, and enter the URL of the diagram you want to use.

For example: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgraph/drawio-diagrams/dev/examples/maths-examples.drawio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgraph/drawio-diagrams/dev/examples/maths-examples.drawio)

**Note:** This must be the file data, not the page on which the file is attached.

Click _Create_, and draw.io will open the template diagram in a new browser tab. Name your diagram, and now you can edit it as you need.

See the [drawio-diagrams repository on GitHub](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-diagrams) for more ways to use these examples as templates for your diagrams.
