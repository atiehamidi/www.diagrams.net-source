With diagrams.net, you can switch [editor themes](/blog/diagram-editor-theme.html) via the menu - Default, Minimal, Sketch (whiteboard) or Dark. Alternatively, use the new toggle switch in the top right to to enable or disable the [simple whiteboard](/blog/sketch-online-whiteboard.html) editor layout and [dark mode](/blog/dark-mode-diagram-editor.html) for your current editor theme.

**Note:** If you are in light mode, the icon in the top right will be a sun. If you are in dark mode, it will be a moon. 

## Switch between modes in diagrams.net

1. Click on the sun/moon icon in the top right.

2. Click on _Simple_ to switch to the Sketch online whiteboard editor theme. You don't need to reload your browser tab. Click on it again to switch back to your previous editor theme.
3. Click on _Dark_ to switch to dark mode in whatever editor theme you are using. Click on it again to return to light mode. 

<br />
### Dark mode works on all editor themes

When you switch into dark mode, the editor will automatically switch some colours of shapes and text so they are more readable.

**Tip:** Many diagrams in the template diagram will also work in dark mode - click on the magnifying glass in the top right of a diagram in the [template library](/blog/template-diagrams.html) to see how it looks in dark mode.

### Use diagrams.net as an online whiteboard

The simple mode switches to the [Sketch online whiteboard editor theme](/blog/sketch-online-whiteboard.html). 
* Use the tools on the left to add shapes, tables, and text, and draw a [freehand shape](/doc/faq/insert-freehand-shapes.html). 
* Click on the ``+`` in the toolbar to access shape libraries and templates.
* To show or hide the format panel on the right in this simple editor layout, press ``Ctrl+Shift+P`` on Windows or ``Cmd+Shift+P`` on MacOS.
* Access the [layers](/doc/layers.html) and [tags](/blog/tags-in-diagrams.html) panels and change editor preferences via the menu in the top left.


**Simplify the drawing canvas**
1. Make sure nothing is selected in your diagram so you can see the _Diagram_ tab in the format panel on the right. 
2. Disable the [_Grid_](/doc/faq/editor-grid-change.html) and [_Page View_](/doc/faq/editor-page-view.html) checkboxes.
