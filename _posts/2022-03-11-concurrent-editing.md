When collaborating in real time using diagrams.net, you can now choose to show your mouse cursor. For example, sharing your cursor with your team makes it easier to ask about or explain something in a diagram or on a [quick whiteboard sketch](/blog/sketch-online-whiteboard.html) as you work on it together. 

This feature is particularly useful when you want to follow a user's focus as they step through a mockup or wireframe model of a webpage or application during a usability review.

## Diagram together in real time

Real-time collaboration is available when you store your diagram files in Microsoft OneDrive or in Google Drive. 

Make sure you have set the appropriate permissions to [share the diagram file](/doc/faq/share-diagrams.html) with edit access before you and your team each open the diagram file for editing. 

**Update to the most recent version of diagrams.net**

If you don't see this feature, you will need to clear your browser's cache first so you can load the most recent version of the editor. 

Go to [app.diagrams.net/clear.html](https://app.diagrams.net/clear.html), then click on the _Start App_ link. 

Select _File > Open_ from the menu, browse to and select the diagram file in your cloud platform, and open it in the editor.

### Share your cursor in diagrams.net

Right-click on a blank area of the diagram to open the context menu, and select _Share Cursor_.

Each person who is editing the diagram is assigned a colour. 

When they share their cursor, their name is shown with their pointer as they move around diagrams.net and edit the shared diagram.

**Tip:** It is less disorienting to see the other users' cursors than to see shapes and connectors 'pop in'.

### See selections in real time

Even if someone has not shared their cursor, the shapes and connectors that they select on the drawing canvas will still be highlighted in their assigned colour.

While the user on the right in the example below hasn't shared their cursor, the other user can see they have selected the Professor class, as it is highlighted in pink.
