You can now create and store your diagrams directly in Notion pages using the draw.io for Notion extension for the Chrome, Opera and Edge web browsers. The draw.io for Notion extension uses the whiteboard-like simple editor theme, and resizes the embedded image displayed in your Notion page automatically to display your entire diagram.

Diagrams embedded and stored in Notion can only contain one diagram page. If you want to use [multi-page diagrams](/blog/multiple-page-diagrams.html), you can [embed images of these diagram pages in your Notion content](/blog/embed-diagrams-notion.html) but store the diagram files in a cloud storage platform like Google Drive or One Drive.

## Install the draw.io for Notion extension

If you click away from the diagram editor on another location in your notion page, the diagram editor will close, and the diagram will be automatically centred and resized to the contents of your diagram.

Creating a diagram in the draw.io for Notion extension is just like using diagrams.net and draw.io.

**New to diagramming?** Follow this [tutorial to create a simple flowchart](/doc/getting-started-basic-flowchart.html) and get used to the diagram editor features.

Here's a quick recap:

**Zoom in and out:** Use the mouse wheel or the toolbar in the top right.

**Move around the diagram:** Hold down the middle or right mouse button and dragging the canvas.

**Add shapes:** Drag shapes from the toolbar or double-click on the drawing canvas to add a shape. 

**Connect shapes:** Drag connectors from the direction arrows or connection points that appear when you hover over existing shapes.

**Style shapes:** Use the format panel on the right to change the styles of selected shapes connectors and text. The tools that are available in this panel will change depending on what you have selected.

**Access tools, shape libraries and templates**

* Hover over any tool in the diagram editor to see a tooltip. 
* Click on the _Shapes_ tool in the toolbar on the left to access more shapes, search for shapes and enable more shape libraries. 
* Click on the _Templates_ tool to open the template library and insert a diagram template.

Drag and move any of the floating panels to another location within the page to keep the drawing canvas clear. To expand or collapse a floating panel, click on the arrow in the title. To close a floating panel, click on the cross in the top right.

**Tip:** If you prefer to work with a grid, click on an empty space in your diagram so you can see the _Diagram_ tab in the format panel, then enable the _Grid_ checkbox.

### Import a diagram

You need to insert a new, blank diagram when you want to import an existing diagram file. 
* Click on the menu icon in the top left, then select _Import from_ and select the location where you have stored your diagram file.
