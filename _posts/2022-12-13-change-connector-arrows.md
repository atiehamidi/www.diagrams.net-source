There are many different styles of connectors - the lines that join shapes in a diagram. Some are plain, some have arrows, and some have particular symbols to show a type of connection. Change the connector arrows and their styles in the Style tab of the format panel.

## Change a connector arrow


Select the connector that you want to style, then go to the _Style_ tab on the format panel.

Click on the drop-down list for the _Start_ and _End_ of the connector and choose a different connector arrow from the long list.

If you don't see all of these arrows and connector symbols, you may need to make your browser window larger!

**Connectors in shape libraries**

Several shape libraries contain connectors with specific arrows or symbols used to create those types of diagrams. For example, the UML shape library contains the different connectors for class diagrams with symbols to indicate inheritance, dependency, aggregation, and so on. 

Hover over any shape to see a larger preview.

## Style connector arrows

**Resize the arrow:** To change the size of an arrow or symbol on a connector, change the thickness of the connector. The arrow/symbol will be resized in proportion to the line width.

Click on the _Linewidth_ up and down arrows, or enter a new size in the text box.

**Change the arrow's fill:** Open the _Properties_ section, and enable or disable the _Start Fill_ and _End Fill_ checkboxes.

**Apply the sketch rough style**

The rough sketch style makes connectors look hand-drawn, and also changes the connector arrows. 

1. Select the connector(s) you want to restyle. 
2. In the _Style_ tab of the format panel, enable the _Sketch_ checkbox. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/connector-arrow-rough.png" style="width=100%;max-width:200px;height:auto;" alt="For hand-drawn connectors and arrow heads, enable the Sketch style in the Style tab of the format panel">

Filled connector arrows will automatically use the rough fill style, which, depending on the size of the arrow or symbol, may then appear unfilled.


**Apply the sketch comic style**

The comic style keeps the solid fill of a connector arrow, but still uses a hand-drawn style.
1. In the _Style_ tab of the format panel, expand the _Properties_.
2. At the bottom, change the _Sketch Style_ to _Comic_. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/connector-arrow-comic.png" style="width=100%;max-width:200px;height:auto;" alt="Change the connector's Sketch Style property to Comic to ensure the fill colour is solid while still using a hand-drawn style">

In this example, the solid square at the start of the right connector has been filled in, but the circle at the end of the other connector is still empty, as it was unfilled.

## Swap the source and target arrows
When you reverse the direction of a connector, the arrow heads (and labels) at each end will swap. 

1. Select a connector.
2. In the _Arrange_ tab of the format panel on the right, click _Reverse_.

## Change connector arrows in the simple editor

The Sketch or simple editor theme is an online whiteboard with fewer diagramming tools displayed by default to give you a larger drawing canvas. You'll need to display the format panel first.

Click on the menu icon and select _Format_.

Alternatively, press ``Ctrl+Shift+P`` to display or hide the format panel.
