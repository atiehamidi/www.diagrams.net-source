If you are having trouble with your personal Google Drive account, see how to [fix connection issues with Google Drive](/doc/faq/google-drive-connection-problems.html), and make sure you have granted draw.io the [permissions needed to work with diagrams in Google Workplace (G Suite)](/doc/faq/gsuite-permissions.html).

When you can work with diagrams stored in your personal Google Drive but not in a Google Workplace account, your administrator may not have allowed third-party apps on your company's Google Workplace domain.

## Authorise third party apps in Google Workplace (G Suite)

1. As an administrator, go to [admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com), then navigate to _Google Apps > Drive > General Settings_.
2. On the right, enable the check box _Allow users to install Google Drive apps_ then save your changes. It may take a short time for the system to update, after which your users will be able to install the draw.io add-ons in Google Workplace apps themselves.

If you don't want to enable this setting and allow your users to individually install the add-ons, [install draw.io domain wide](/doc/faq/gsuite-addons-domain-wide.html).
