You can share and collaborate on diagrams with anyone, either inside or outside of your company, when they are stored as public files in your Google Drive account.

Publishing a diagram as a URL results in a very long link - your diagram is encoded in the link that is generated. If the diagram is stored as a public file on Google Drive, a prettier, shorter URL is generated.

## Publish your diagram as a link

1. While you are editing your diagram in draw.io, click _File > Publish > Link_.
2. Click the _Check_ link to make sure your diagram file is public, then click _OK_. If it's not public, follow the steps below to change the file sharing settings, then return here.  <br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/google-drive-publish-link2.png" style="width=100%;max-width:300px;height:auto;" alt="Change the sharing permissions to public so you can publish a link to the diagram file stored on Google Drive">
3. Select the options you want to use, then click _Create_.
   * **Links:** Open in the current browser window or in a new window. You can change the border colour of links if you want too.
   * **Lightbox:** This changes how your diagram is displayed. If you deselect this checkbox, when someone clicks on the link you share with them, your diagram will immediately open in the editor.
   * **Edit:** Either allow someone to edit your original diagram, or create their own copy of the diagram (default).
   * **Layers:** Allow viewers to turn layers on and off in the lightbox.
4. Press ``Ctrl+C`` to copy the link that is generated. You can share this via a Facebook post or tweet on Twitter by clicking on the icons at the bottom of the dialog. Click _Close_ to return to your diagram.

### Change the file sharing settings of your diagram to public

If you are using Google Drive within your business, you'll have a few additional sharing settings. You will still need to share the diagram as a public file in order to publish it as a short link.
1. In Google Drive, right click on the diagram you want to share, then select _Share_ from the context menu.
2. In the Google Drive _Get Link_ dialog, click on _Change to anyone with the link_.

3. The dialog will update and show you that _Anyone with the link_ will be able to view the file. Click _Done_.
