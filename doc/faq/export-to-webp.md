1. Open the draw.io menu and click _Export As > WebP_.
2. Change the export settings to suit your requirements.
   * Choose the _Zoom_ factor, set a _Border_ width around your diagram.
   * If you only want to export the shapes and connectors that are currently selected, enable the _Selection only_ checkbox. This only appears if you have selected part of your diagram.
   * Select whether to print the entire _Diagram_ (default) or just a single diagram _Page_ from the _Size_ drop down list.
   * If you are diagramming in [dark mode](/blog/dark-mode-diagram-editor.html), change the _Appearance_ to _Dark_. 
   * Enable the checkboxes if you want a _Shadow_ on your shapes, or to include the _Grid_ of the drawing canvas.
