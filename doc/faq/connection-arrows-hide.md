Connection arrows are the four direction arrows that appear when you hover over a shape in draw.io. By default, connection arrows are displayed, but you can hide this feature.

1. Make sure nothing is selected in your diagram so you can see the _Diagram_ tab in the format panel.
2. Click on the _Connection Arrows_ checkbox to hide or display the four direction arrows that appear when you hover over a shape on the drawing canvas.

All of the connection arrows throughout your diagram will now be hidden when you hover over shapes.
