You can group related shapes and connectors, and then work with them as if they were a single shape on the drawing canvas. 

1. Select the shapes and connectors you want to group, either by dragging a selection box around all of the shapes and connectors, or hold ``Shift`` and click each shape/connector. 
2. Group the shapes using your preferred method:
   * In the format panel on the right, click on _Group_.

## Work with grouped shapes

**Move:** Move the grouped shapes just like you would a single shape by dragging it to a new position on the drawing canvas. 

**Resize:** Now that your shapes and connectors are grouped, you can drag the corner or side grab handles to resize all of the shapes within the group, relative to each other. 

**Rotate:** Drag the rotate symbol in the top right corner to rotate all of the shapes in the group around a central point.
