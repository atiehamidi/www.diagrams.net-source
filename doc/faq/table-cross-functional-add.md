Cross-functional flowcharts ([tables](/blog/tables.html)) use categories to group steps in a business process.

Create a table with horizontal and vertical swimlanes using the _Table_ tool in the toolbar.

1. With nothing selected in your diagram, click on the _Table_ tool in the toolbar.
2. Select the _Container_ checkbox, or hold down the ``Ctrl``/``Cmd`` key while you select a table with the number of rows and columns you need. Click to add the table with cross-functional swimlanes to the drawing canvas.

3. Select the table, click on a title cell, then enter the title text. When you enter one of the row titles, the text will be centred - it will move into the correct position when you finish adding the text.

The cells in a cross-functional table function as container shapes so you can add shapes to them and join them with connectors.
