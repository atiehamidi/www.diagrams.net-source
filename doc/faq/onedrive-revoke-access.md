Microsoft allows you to revoke an app's permission to access OneDrive. This works differently in personal and business accounts.

## Personal OneDrive accounts

1. Go to [https://account.live.com/consent/Manage](https://account.live.com/consent/Manage). This page lists the apps and services you've given access to.
2. Click _Edit_ under the draw.io app.
