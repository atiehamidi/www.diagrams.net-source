The barrier to anyone diagramming and whiteboarding with diagrams.net is lower compared to many other SaaS applications. From reviews and customer feedback, some of the things they like the most include:
* you don't need to register and it costs nothing
* you can diagram in all major operating systems
* there is an offline desktop version
* you can give your diagram to anyone else and they will be able to load and edit it freely
* you can store unlimited diagram files wherever you prefer
* project development is in the open and anyone can take part

But don't take our word for it - here is what draw.io and diagrams.net users are actually saying on popular review sites.

## On Capterra

Capterra verifies reviewers through LinkedIn and checks their reviews for a range of fraudulent activity and credibility. They are one most popular software review sites for businesses.
