diagrams.net is a [unique security-first diagramming tool](/blog/data-protection.html) in that we provide the application platform, but your diagram data only lives in your computer memory while you are working on it.  As you can [store your diagrams on your preferred enterprise-level cloud storage platforms](/blog/secure-diagramming-storage.html) or on your local device, diagrams.net gives you control over your diagram data.

Some extended editor features, such as PDF generation (``File > Export As > PDF``), are only available from the diagrams.net server endpoints. In these cases, your diagram data is securely transmitted from your browser to our server endpoint, and when the converted file is sent back to your browser, your diagram data is deleted from the diagrams.net server.

Data is encrypted during all network transmission up to the endpoint processing.

**Data governance regions for server endpoints**

diagrams.net is delivered via Cloudflare edge data centers and data transmitted outbound is directed via those same Cloudflare centers. The server endpoints are all located within AWS data centers. The features requiring server-side functionality are:

- Translation of ``vsd``, ``vss``, and ``vdx`` files to ``vsdx``. diagrams.net understands ``vsdx`` natively in JavaScript on the client.
- Import of Gliffy files.
- Migration of EMF images embedded in ``vsd``/``vsdx`` files. EMF licensing means only the Windows operating system may manipulate these.
- Generation of PlantUML diagrams. PlantUML is written in Java.
- Generation of PDFs of diagrams.
- Collaborative editing by sending only deltas of changes to other editors.

Wherever possible we use serverless (AWS Lambda) functionality to reduce the attack surface of the endpoints.

diagrams.net has server endpoints in three regions: one in the EU (in Frankfurt, Germany), one in the US (in Northern Virginia), and one in Australia (AU). By default, invoking each of the above functions will use the server endpoint that is nearest to the Cloudflare data center that the request entered via. That is, geolocation is not performed on your IP address to determine the endpoint.

However, you can force the endpoint locations, rather than rely on entering the Cloudflare network at the right place. Specifying ``dataGovernance`` region in the editor configuration to ``EU`` or ``US`` ensures diagrams.net uses your preferred server endpoint. 


**Data transmission lockdown**


Additionally, you can use the ``lockdown`` toggle in the editor configuration to disable data transmission apart from directly between your browser where you are editing your diagram, and the [cloud platform or location you have chosen to store the diagram file](/doc/faq/storage-location-select.html). 

## Set server endpoints and disable data transmission


1. Select _Extras > Configuration_ to customise diagrams.net.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/extras-configuration-menu.png" style="width=100%;max-width:300px;height:auto;" alt="Access the diagrams.net configuration via Extras > Configuration">
2. Add the following [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](http://www.json.org/) string: ``"dataGovernance": "EU"`` or ``"dataGovernance": "US"``.
3. To restrict data transmission to between your browser and your storage location, add the following JSON string: ``"lockdown": true"``. Note the dataGovernance value is ignored with lockdown set to true.

4. Click _Apply_ to save your changes, and then reload the diagrams.net editor (refresh the browser page).


## Data residency in Atlassian Cloud


The architectures for draw.io for Confluence and Jira Cloud are identical to those used with diagrams.net. However, you can set the data governance rules centrally for all users on your Confluence instance.

If you are using the draw.io apps for Confluence or Jira Cloud, [Atlassian lets you additionally set your **data residency** region](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-data-residency-976763149.html) to choose where your data or _in-scope product content_ resides. That means the content of your instance and associated metadata will be stored on servers in that region when it is at rest.

An administrator can set the server endpoint in the draw.io app Configuration in the administration settings via the JSON string.

You can also vote for our existing server endpoint deployments, or submit your own endpoint location request at the issue tracker:

- [Endpoint for Brazil](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/issues/1815)
- [Endpoint for India](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/issues/1816)
- [Endpoint for Japan](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/issues/1817)
