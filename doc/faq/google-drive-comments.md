You can add comments to diagrams, reply to and resolve comments on files stored in Google Drive, as well as [comments on draw.io diagrams attached to pages in Atlassian Confluence Cloud, Data Center and Server instances](/doc/faq/confluence-comments.html). 

## Work with comments on diagrams in Google Drive

Comments are useful when working on diagrams in teams in Google Drive, or leaving feedback for teachers and students on [diagrams in Google Classroom](/blog/google-classroom-diagrams.html).

**View comments:** Open your diagram file from Google Drive in the draw.io editor, then select _View > Comments_ from the menu.  

**Add a comment:** Click on _Create_ (``+``) at the bottom of the Comments dialog, enter your comment in the text field, then click _Save_.

To allow others to make comments on your diagrams, you must share your diagram file with at least the Commenter role enabled.

**Edit and delete comments:** Under each saved comment are some options - you can _Edit_ and _Delete_ your own comments. 

**Reply to a comment:** You can reply to other people's comments. Click on _Reply_, enter your comment and click _Save_. Replies will be nested.

**See new comments:** Click on the circular _Refresh_ icon at the bottom of the _Comments_ dialog.

**Resolve comments:** Click on _Resolve_ under the comment (or thread) you want to resolve. It will disappear from the list of open comments. To see all comments, click on the tick button at the bottom of the _Comment_ dialog. Resolved comments are not displayed in the diagram viewer.

Click on _Reopen_ if you want to reopen a comment thread.

**Work with comments in the viewer:** The draw.io viewer will also show comments by default, but you need to open the diagram in the editor to add, edit, and delete comments and write replies. You can _Resolve_ comments when using the draw.io viewer. 

To copy a link to a specific comment, click the vertical dots next to the _Resolve_ button, and select _Link to this comment_.
