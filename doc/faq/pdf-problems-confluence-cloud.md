draw.io for Confluence Cloud may have problems generating a PDF of your diagrams if they are too large.

**Note:** This only applies to Confluence Cloud, and not Confluence Server.

Huge diagrams might cause a timeout on the draw.io servers that generate the PDFs. This might result in a blank or corrupt PDF being returned.

If you have this problem instead of exporting to a PDF, [please print your diagram to a PDF file](/doc/faq/pdf-print-to.html).
