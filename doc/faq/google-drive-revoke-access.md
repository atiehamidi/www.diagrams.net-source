Your diagrams will remain in your Google Drive, but the draw.io web application at app.diagrams.net will not be able to access your Google Drive.

If you wish to continue working with diagrams stored in Google Drive, you can reconnect it easily. Select Google Drive as your storage location when you [create a new diagram using draw.io online](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=google) and authorise the application again.

Note that draw.io has been tested extensively for security, including passing Google's security audit for internal usage with Google Drive in 2018. If your IT administrator has security concerns, [please direct them to our support page on GitHub](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/wiki/Getting-Support).
