Google Drive supports version control, where changes to your files are automatically saved as a different version. This includes .drawio diagrams that are created using the draw.io add-on for Google Drive.

When you store your diagrams in Google Drive, draw.io automatically saves the changes you make to the files version history.

1. From within the draw.io editor, select _File > Revision History_ from the menu to see the different versions of your diagram.
