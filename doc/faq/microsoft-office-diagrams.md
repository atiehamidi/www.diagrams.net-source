### Resize and rotate your diagram

Your diagram is embedded as an image, and can be edited like any other embedded picture in your document.

1. First, select the diagram in your document.
2. Drag the grab handles on the side or corners to resize it.
3. Drag the rotate handle at the top of your diagram to rotate it.

### Recolour your diagram

1. Select the diagram, then select the _Picture Format_ tab in the toolbar.
2. Click on the _Color_ tool in the toolbar, then select a new colour. Note that this does not change the colours in the diagram file.

### Update embedded diagrams to see changes

Your diagrams are displayed as images inside your Word document, Excel spreadsheet or Powerpoint presentation. When the diagram file that is stored in your Google Drive or One Drive has been edited in draw.io, you'll need to regenerate the images to see those changes reflected in your document.

1. Select the _Insert_ tab in the toolbar.
2. Select the diagram you want to update, and click _Update Selected_. To update all of the diagrams in your document, click _Update All_.
