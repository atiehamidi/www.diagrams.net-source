DESKTOP VERSIONS PRE 10.7.5 ARE STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL A NEW DESKTOP BUILD
{: .alert .alert-danger}

Desktop versions prior to 10.7.5 have a critical security flaw, so we’re disabling them all, sorry. To resolve, just go to the draw.io desktop project on GitHub, [https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases), and download the latest version for your platform. Once that’s installed, you’re good to go again.

Versions of draw.io Desktop from 10.7.5 onwards run completely isolated from the internet, so the security hole can’t reappear.
