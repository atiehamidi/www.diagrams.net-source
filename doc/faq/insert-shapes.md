While you would normally double click on the drawing canvas and select a shape, or drag a shape from the shape libraries, you can also add some basic shapes via the _Arrange > Insert_ menu. 

Select _Arrange > Insert_ then choose one of _Rectangle_, _Ellipse_ or _Rhombus_ to add that shape to the drawing canvas.  Alternatively, click the ``+`` icon in the toolbar, then select the shape you want to insert.
