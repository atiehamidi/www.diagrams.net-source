As draw.io aims to become the de facto diagramming tool, used by everyone around the world, it's important to be able to import from a variety of file formats and from a number of storage locations.

Of course, we are always looking to expand the import formats and storage platforms that draw.io supports.

## draw.io import formats

Right now, you can import diagrams and components in the following file formats:

- .drawio 
- .xml files saved from draw.io
- Gliffy diagram files
- .vsdx and .vsd diagram files
- Lucidchart diagram files
- PNG image files (with or without the embedded XML of a .drawio diagram)
- SVG images
- JPEG images

Plus using the text-based import tools (_Arrange > Insert > ..._) you can create diagrams using:
- SQL code
- CSV data (you'll need to describe how to translate that into a diagram)
- Text
- PlantUML code
- Freehand drawing

**Note:** Some of these text-based input methods are only available in [our online editor](https://app.diagrams.net).

If you are using the draw.io app for Atlassian Confluence, you can even convert _all_ of your Gliffy diagrams in your Confluence instance to .drawio diagrams in just a few clicks using the automated draw.io Gliffy mass import tool.

## Import diagrams from these sources

draw.io works with diagrams and images stored at a number of locations.

- Local storage: in-browser only, or stored on your local hard drive (desktop or mobile).
- Cloud platforms: Google Drive, OneDrive, NextCloud, and Dropbox.
- GitHub and GitLab.

And because draw.io is open source, there is an ever-increasing ecosystem of draw.io third-party integrations which support even more storage locations and applications!
