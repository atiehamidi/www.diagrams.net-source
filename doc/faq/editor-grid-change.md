Use the editor grid in draw.io to help you align shapes and connectors. By default it is not included when you print the diagram or when you export it to an image format or a PDF file.

**Tip:** To use the editor grid without page border indications, [disable _Page View_](/doc/faq/editor-page-view.html). 

By default, a grid with a size of 10pts in a light grey is displayed on the diagram canvas. You can change its size and colour.

Make sure nothing is selected in your diagram so you can see the _Diagram_ tab in the format panel.  

**Show/hide the editor grid:** Click on the _Grid_ checkbox in the _Diagram_ tab to display or hide the grid on the drawing canvas. 

**Make the editor grid smaller or larger:** Enter a new size in the _Grid_ text field in the _Diagram_ tab, or use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the size of the grid. Alternatively, click _File > Page Setup_ and change the _Grid Size_.

**Set a different editor grid colour:** Click on the colour button next to the _Grid_ size field in the _Diagram_ tab to change the grid's colour, then select a new colour from the palette, or enter a colour's hex code (without a ``#``), and click _Apply_.
