The PNG image file format supports embedded metadata in a number of ways. draw.io can export a PNG image of your diagram and include the diagram itself in the image, by including the XML code in the ``zTxt`` section of the image file.

Embedding the diagram as metadata in an image lets you more easily transfer the file between products, vendors, and platforms without data loss. By including the diagram, the image retains _all_ of the data necessary to continue working on it in the [draw.io online diagram editor](http://app.diagrams.net).

## Open a diagram embedded in a PNG

Drag a ``.png`` file with the embedded diagram data onto the draw.io drawing canvas to keep editing it as you would a ``.drawio`` or ``.xml`` version of your diagram.

**Note:** Some popular image sharing sites may resample PNG images, stripping any unnecessary non-image data from the uploaded file to save space.

## Save a diagram as a PNG

When you save your diagram as a PNG image, the XML of your diagram is included by default.

1. Select _File > Save as_ from the menu.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/save-as.png" style="width=100%;max-width:200px;height:auto;" alt="Select File > Save as to save your diagram as a PNG image">
2. Select _Editable Bitmap Image (.png)_ from the drop down list next to the file name.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/save-as-dialog.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Select Editable Bitmap Image (.png) to save your diagram as a PNG image">
3. Click on the location to which you want to save the PNG image file.

## Export a PNG file with diagram data

1. Select _File > Export As > PNG_.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/export-png.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Export a diagram as a PNG from draw.io">
2. Choose the options you need for the image, and make sure the checkbox for _Include a copy of my diagram_ is enabled as well as _All Pages_ if you also want to include the other diagram pages in the PNG file.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/export-png-options.png"  style="width=100%;max-width:300px;height:auto;" alt="Include your diagram data in the PNG file you export from draw.io">
3. Click _Export_, enter a filename, then select the location to which you want to save your diagram.

**Tip:**
You can also embed your diagram data when you [export a PDF file](/blog/export-pdf.html) or an [SVG image](/blog/export-svg.html) in the same way.
