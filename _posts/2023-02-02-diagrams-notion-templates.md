With our [draw.io for Notion chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/drawio-for-notion/plhaalebpkihaccllnkdaokdoeaokmle), you can easily embed diagrams and the diagram editor directly in your Notion page and in Notion templates when you use Google's Chrome web browser. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/drawio-notion-edit-diagram.png" style="width=100%;max-width:600px;height:auto;" alt="Use the draw.io for Notion Chrome extension to edit diagrams stored in Notion pages and templates as .drawio.svg files">

Diagrams stored in a Notion page are saved as an SVG image file with the diagram data embedded in the file itself. These images use the file extension ``.drawio.svg``. 

The _draw.io for Notion extension_ will automatically change the background of the diagram to match the dark or light theme, whichever is set in the user's Notion settings. 

### Not using Chrome?

If you aren't using Chrome and the draw.io for Notion extension, you can still see the diagram in the page as an SVG image on a light background.

You can also right-click and download the image files and open them in [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) because the diagram data is embedded right there in the SVG image. 

You can embed the ``.drawio.svg`` image files in normal webpages too. For example, the flowchart below is an SVG file with embedded diagram data - download and open this image file in the diagrams.net or draw.io editor to edit the diagram. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/application-process.drawio.svg" style="width=100%;max-width:600px;height:auto;" alt="You can embed .drawio.svg files in normal websites, download them and then open them in app.diagrams.net to edit the diagrams">

**Note:** Different browsers may not download the full diagram data when you save the image file. If you are having trouble opening it as a diagram in the editor, try downloading the SVG image file using another browser.

## Copy a Notion template with diagrams

Our example [Visual onboarding with diagrams Notion template](https://sudsy-rest-88a.notion.site/Visual-onboarding-with-diagrams-c654d8821c4547c798046359466c14d7) includes a variety of embedded diagrams.

To copy a Notion template, click on _Duplicate_ in the top right, then select where you want to store the Notion page. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/drawio-notion-template-duplicate.png" style="width=100%;max-width:600px;height:auto;" alt="Click on Duplicate in the top right of a Notion template to make a copy of the page - this copies any diagrams that are embedded in the Notion template">

This copies everything - including the SVG images with the embedded diagram data. 

## Work with diagram files stored in Notion

1. First, install the [draw.io for Notion extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/drawio-for-notion/plhaalebpkihaccllnkdaokdoeaokmle) from the Chrome webstore.
2. Pin the extension in Chrome so you can access it easily.

**Add a diagram to a Notion page or template**

* To add a new diagram to the end of the Notion page click on the draw.io for Notion extension, then click on _Insert Diagram_. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/drawio-notion-insert-diagram.png" style="width=100%;max-width:250px;height:auto;" alt="Click on the draw.io for Notion extension and select Insert Diagram to add a new diagram to you Notion template">

* To add a new diagram in a specific position, click on the link (where it says _click here_), and drag the file that is downloaded into the right position in your Notion page.

**Edit a diagram:** Click on the diagram in the Notion page to open the in-page diagram editor. 

The simple whiteboard-style editor layout uses floating panels containing the format and style tools, shape libraries, tags, layers, and more. Drag these panels into the positions you want around your browser window.

To make the editor take up more of your browser window, click on the _Fullscreen_ icon.

**Move a diagram:** Drag the diagram component to a new position, just like you would any other type of Notion content.

**Copy a diagram:** Hover over the diagram and click on _More Actions_ then select _Duplicate_. This creates a copy of the diagram directly below, just like duplicating any other content component in Notion.

**Delete a diagram:** Hover over the diagram, click on _More Actions_ in the top left, then select _Delete_.

### Turn a Notion page with diagrams into a template

1. Click on _Share_ at the top of your Notion page. 
2. Enable _Share to web_ to generate a shareable link. 
3. If you don't see the Link options, click on _Show link options_, and make sure _Allow duplicate as template_ is enabled.

Notion users that open your template page can now _Duplicate_ it into their own Notion spaces.
