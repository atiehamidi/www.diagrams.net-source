Keyboard shortcuts in draw.io (and the draw.io apps developed by JGraph) enable you work with shapes and connectors in your diagrams both easier and faster. There are a number of ways you can select shapes and connectors with the keyboard, or when holding down a key and using the mouse.

## Select shapes with keyboard shortcuts

**Select everything:** Press ``Ctrl+A`` on Windows or ``Cmd+A`` on macOS to select all shapes and connectors. 

**Select all connectors:** Press ``Ctrl+E`` on Windows or ``Cmd+E`` on macOS to select all connectors (no shapes).

**Select all shapes:** Press ``Ctrl+I`` (Windows) or ``Ctrl+E`` (macOS) to select all shapes and text shapes (no connectors).

**Deselect everything:** Press ``Ctrl+Shift+A`` (Windows) or ``Cmd+Shift+A`` (macOS) to deselect everything.

## Cycle selection through the diagram

**Select next or previous shape:** Press ``Tab`` to select the next shape. Press ``Shift+Tab`` to select the previous shape in your diagram.

<br />This keyboard shortcut steps into container shapes, cycling through the shapes that it contains, as well as the text labels on connectors.

**Select parent shape:** Press ``Alt+Tab`` to select the parent of the currently selected shape in a tree diagram or the containing shape if you have selected a shape inside one. 

Pressing this repeatedly will cycle through all of the parent or container shapes, but not step into the container or select connector labels.

**Select the shape or connector underneath:** When you have shapes or connectors stacked on top of each other, hold down ``Alt`` and click on the shape to select the next shape down the stack, behind the currently selected shape.

## Select intersecting shapes

When you drag a normal selection box without holding ``Alt`` down, only shapes that are fully within the selection box will be selected.

Include and select all shapes that are under the selection box, hold down ``Alt`` as you drag the selection box.

<br />_``Alt+drag`` selects all intersecting shapes, not just those fully inside the selection box._


## Deselect selected shapes

Hold ``Shift`` or ``Ctrl``/``Cmd`` down and click on a selected shape, or drag a selection box around the shapes you want to deselect. 

If you keep holding the key down and clicking on or dragging a selection box around the same shapes, it will act as a toggle selection.
