On rare occasions, huge diagrams may cause a timeout on the PDF generation servers, which might return a blank or corrupt PDF. If the built-in PDF generation via File > Export has problems, you can print your diagram to a PDF file.

1. In the draw.io menu, select _File > Print_ to display the Print dialog.

3. Your operating system and browser will determine what steps you need to follow, for example:
   * If you are using Chrome, set the _Destination_ to _Save as PDF_, then click _Save_.

   * If you are using a different browser on macOS, in the Print dialog, click on the _PDF_ dropdown, then select _Save as PDF_. Enter a filename and then save the file.
