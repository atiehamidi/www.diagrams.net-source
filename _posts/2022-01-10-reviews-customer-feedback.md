The barrier to anyone diagramming with diagrams.net is lower than with other software and web applications. From reviews and customer feedback, some of the things they like the most include:
* you don't need an account
* you can diagram in all three operating systems
* administration is simple
* there are no monthly fees
* you can create a wide range of diagrams
* you can store unlimited diagram files wherever you prefer

But don't take our word for it - here is what draw.io and diagrams.net users are actually saying on popular review sites.

## On Capterra

Capterra verifies reviewers through LinkedIn and checks their reviews for a range of fraudulent activity and credibility. They are one most popular software review sites for businesses.
