You can change the default styles of shapes and connectors easily as you are creating your diagram with _Set as Default Style_ in the _Style_ tab of the format panel. Whenever you add a new shape or connector from the shape library or toolbar, this new default style will be applied.

**Reset the default style**

You can reset this default style of both connectors and shapes via the format panel.

1. Make sure nothing is selected in your diagram so you can see the _Diagram_ tab in the format panel.
2. Click on _Clear Default Style_ on the _Diagram_ tab in the format panel.
