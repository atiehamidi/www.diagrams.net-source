Finding a typo-proof word that is also pronounced the same throughout the world is impossible. diagrams.net and draw.io are no exception to this. Here are the most common ways people have misspelt our applications' names.

**craw.io** - we hope diagrams don't make you angry! Or maybe it's a reference to the cleverness of crows? Most likely, it's a slip of the finger to the key below. 

**dra.io** - the languages with a close appropriate meaning would be Norwegian (to draw or drag) or Swedish (to pull or tell a story). Or perhaps Yola, the Forth and Bargy dialect (to draw) in County Wexford. We bet it's rather typing too fast.

**dran.io** - your turn! _(German)_ Seriously, we're not sure how ``n`` slips in for ``w`` as those two keys are usually far from each other in most layouts. Perhaps Maltron 3D keyboard users slipping from the ``a``?

**draq.io** - uncertain, unexpected, indefinable, but riveting. Or perhaps fashionable? We reckon it's an off-by-one-key error.

**drag.io** - a wonderfully concise description of [how to use diagrams.net and draw.io](/doc/getting-started-editor.html) - drag shapes onto the canvas and drag connectors between them!

**drsw.io** - can we buy a vowel please?

**drwa.io** - Polish for firewood or wood, we think? Also Creole for right (entitlement).

**dwaw.io** - this brings to mind an old movie ... 
<br />``    "Mawwiage ... mawwiage is what bwings us togevvar, today."``

**draw.net** and **diagrams.io** - the inevitable combinations of draw.io and diagrams.net.

**diagram.io** - you're only allowed a single diagram with this variation!

**graph.io** - most likely because both diagrams.net and draw.io are developed by us here at [JGraph](https://github.com/jgraph).

**drow.io** - flanked by dark elves! Seriously though, the ``aw`` sound in English is difficult in other languages - in Japanese, it is closest to the vowel ``o``. 
<br />_drow.io may look like it redirects to diagrams.net - but it's your autocorrect fixing the URL without you noticing!_

**ddra.io** - when said aloud, this is suspiciously close to _daedra_. Perhaps we should ask Bethesda if Hermaeus Mora, Jyggalag or Peryite is the patron prince of diagrams. Ooo, an idea - a wabbajack tool for hilarious chaos when teams collaborate!

It's summer, and our brains are a little fried from the recent heatwaves. If you'd like to contribute additional misspellings or propose different meanings for those above, share it with [draw.io on Twitter](https://twitter.com/drawio).
