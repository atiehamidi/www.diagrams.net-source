diagrams.net has registered its draw.io application repositories ([jgraph/drawio](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) and [jgraph/drawio-desktop](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop)) on [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/). This service is used by security researchers and developers to report security vulnerabilities in any GitHub repository, and receive a bug-bounty for their report. 

1. Authorise [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/) to access your GitHub account, if you haven't already done so - click on _Login_ in the top right of the page, and follow the prompts to authorise access.
2. View the [jgraph/drawio](https://huntr.dev/bounties/?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjgraph%2Fdrawio) or the [jgraph/drawio-desktop](https://huntr.dev/bounties/?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjgraph%2Fdrawio) listing.
3. Click on the _Submit report_ link - below and to the right of the listing - and fill in the report form with as much detail as you can.

**Note:** Reporting the same bug in both repositories will mark one as a duplicate.

We will review and validate your report if the bug is indeed a security risk. You'll receive a notification via email on validation and confirmation of a bug-fix once it is released. 

At this point, huntr.dev will calculate the CVE bounty - based on the severity of the valid and fixed security vulnerability - then release the bounty to you as per their payment terms.
