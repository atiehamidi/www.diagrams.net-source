Instead of styling every shape individually, you can style one, then apply that style to multiple selected shapes via the format panel.

1. Update the style of one of the shapes or connectors in your diagram. Note that shape and connector styles must be copied and pasted separately.
2. Select that shape or connector, in the _Style_ tab of the format panel, click _Copy Style_.
3. Select the other shapes or connectors that you want to apply this style to. In the _Style_ tab, click on _Paste Style_.

**Tip:** There are [many shortcuts for working with styles](/blog/shortcut-styles) in draw.io.
