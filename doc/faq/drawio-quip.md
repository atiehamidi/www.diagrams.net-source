As of 8th June 2022 the draw.io for Quip live app is in maintenance mode. From this point on:

1. You will not be able to insert new diagrams.
2. You will be able to edit existing diagrams.
3. We will not always apply security fixes where available in the open source project.

Note that no users ever paid for draw.io for Quip commercially, it was provided as-is, for free.

There is an alternative diagramming solution in Quip, [Lucidchart](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000Ecs7FUAR), which can import draw.io diagrams.
