By default, you can drag a connector from a shape and drop it on an empty area of the drawing canvas to have an unattached connector. 

To create flows quickly, where there are a large number of the same shape connected, enable _Copy on Connect_. 

1. Select _Extras > Copy on Connect_ from the menu. 
2. Now, when you drag a connector from a shape, it will add and connect a copy of the source shape.

**Note:** This is a toggle - if enabled, a tick will appear next to the menu item when it is enabled. Select it again to disable _Copy on Connect_.
