JGraph is pleased to announce that draw.io is the only secure diagramming application to meet Atlassian's new **Cloud Fortified** standard. 

The draw.io app for Confluence is a diagramming application natively integrated into Confluence. If Confluence is your single point of truth for documentation, draw.io is your most secure choice for diagramming and visualization. draw.io for Confluence is created and maintained by JGraph, alongside our [online draw.io editor](https://app.diagrams.net), desktop application and other [integrations](/integrations.html).

## What is Atlassian Cloud Fortified?

Atlassian developed the more [rigorous Cloud Fortified standard](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/categories/cloud-fortified-apps) to highlight enterprise-grade apps with a particular focus on reliability and service, in addition to increased security requirements. 

By including strict reliability and support requirements, the new standard goes above and beyond the Atlassian Cloud Security program. 

As a security-first diagramming app for Atlassian Cloud products, the draw.io developer JGraph has continued to work closely with Atlassian over the years, participating in security initiatives as they are made available to app developers.

### draw.io is Atlassian Cloud Fortified

As a Cloud Fortified app, draw.io and JGraph meets the following requirements:

* Participate in all of Atlassian's cloud app security programs, including the automated [Ecoscanner](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/ecoscanner/), as well as the [VDP](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/vdp/), [AMS](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/vulnerability-tracking-more-info/), [Marketplace Bug Bounty](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/marketplace-security-bug-bounty-program/), and the [security self-assessment](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/security-self-assessment-program/)  programs.
* Meet all of the [security requirements for Marketplace cloud apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/security-requirements/).
* Pass strict checks for [service reliability and performance at scale](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/cloud-fortified-apps-program-reliability-requirements/), including automated checks to ensure a 99.9% or higher app availability. 
* Proactively [review compatibility with upcoming host product updates](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Marketplace-Apps-Integrations/Introducing-Cloud-Fortified-meet-the-first-Cloud-Fortified-apps/ba-p/1749111).
* Abide by the [Atlassian-defined app support SLAs](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/sla-management/) and integrate with Atlassian's process to ensure fast incident response and resolution times.

Set the draw.io **lockdown** option as a JSON string in the app configuration to additionally restrict data transmission to _only_ between a user's browser and their Confluence Cloud instance: 
<br />``"lockdown": true``
