To increase the amount of drawing canvas space quickly in diagrams.net and our draw.io apps, click on _Fullscreen_ in the top right or select _View > Fullscreen_. The drawing canvas will expand to fill your browser window.

Click a second time on the _Fullscreen_ tool, or select _View > Fullscreen_ to display them again.

This toggle hides the filename and _Share_ button at the top of the page, as well as the Shapes and format panels on either side of the drawing canvas. 

**Tip:** To add the most common shapes and text, even with the Shapes panel closed, [double-click on the drawing canvas to see the shape selection dialog](/blog/double-click-shortcut.html). Select a shape to add it to the drawing canvas. 

## Minimise _parts_ of the editor

If _Fullscreen_ hides the tools you need to use regularly (styles, shape libraries), you can hide or minimise the parts of the editor you don't need.

**Floating dialogs:** Drag these around the browser window to get them out of your way. To minimise or hide, click on _View_ on the toolbar, or use the _Minimise_ and _Close_ buttons in the top right of each dialog.

Tools that use floating dialogs include: [diagram layers](/doc/layers.html), shape and connector [tags](/blog/tags-in-diagrams.html), the diagram outline, and [the freehand drawing tool](/doc/faq/insert-freehand-shapes.html).

**Ruler:** Select _View > Ruler_ to display or hide the ruler around the outside of the drawing canvas. 

**Scrollbars:** Select _View > Scrollbars_ to display or hide the scrollbars on the right and bottom of the drawing canvas. To move the drawing canvas, click and hold the right or middle mouse button to drag the canvas and see a different part of the diagram.

**Search shapes:** Select _View > Search Shapes_ to display or hide the [search box](/doc/faq/shape-search.html) at the top of the Shapes panel. 

**Scratchpad:** Click on the ``X`` (_Close_) to the right of the [Scratchpad](/doc/faq/scratchpad.html) to hide it, or select _View > Scratchpad_ to toggle it on or off.

**Resize the Shapes panel:** Click and drag the _Collapse/Expand_ bar between the panel and the drawing canvas to change how wide it is.

**Hide the filename and _Share_ button:** Click on the _Collapse/Expand_ icon above the format panel on the far right to hide the filename, the diagrams.net icon and the _Share_ button.

**Hide the format panel:** Click on the _Format Panel_, or press ``Ctrl+Shift+P``, or select _View > Format Panel_ to hide or display the format panel on the right of the drawing canvas.

## Use a simpler editor theme

Select _Extras > Theme_ and select either _Minimal_ or _Sketch_ to [switch to a simpler diagram editor theme](/blog/diagram-editor-theme.html) with a larger drawing canvas.


**Minimal editor theme:** The Shape and format panels are located in floating dialogs in the Minimal editor theme. The menus have been slightly rearranged - check under _Diagram > Preferences_ to show or hide the ruler, or switch to another theme.

**Note:** In the Minimal editor theme, _Preferences > Fullscreen_ activates your operating system's Fullscreen mode, making your browser tab take up your entire screen.

**Sketch whiteboard editor theme:** Alternatively, you can use the [Sketch online whiteboard](/blog/sketch-online-whiteboard.html) editor theme. You can even minimise the toolbar on the left by clicking the little arrow at the bottom.

**Note:** The drawing canvas grid and page view settings are remembered when you switch editor themes. 

To [turn the grid or page view off](/blog/change-drawing-canvas.html), make sure nothing is selected in your diagram, then deselect those checkboxes in the Format panel (in all editor themes).
