In draw.io by default, connectors have arrow heads at one end, where it connects to the target shape. You can remove a connector's arrow heads via the format panel on the right.

1. Select the connector.
2. In the _Style_ tab of the format panel, select the middle or the right drop down list on the second row, then select ``None`` at the top of the lists. This will remove the arrow heads pointing towards the source and target shapes.
