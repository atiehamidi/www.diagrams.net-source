It is easy to diagram on a tablet or any other device with a touch screen because draw.io is a web application. Point your browser to our online editor at [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net), select where you want to save your diagram file, and start diagramming.

## Simple touch whiteboard

The [Sketch diagram editor theme](/blog/sketch-online-whiteboard.html) is ideal for diagramming on the smaller touch screens of mobile devices. 

You can minimise the panels you aren't using to gain additional drawing space. If a panel is in the way, drag it to another position in the diagram editor.

The default more complex [editor themes](/blog/diagram-editor-theme.html) - with the menu, top toolbar and fixed panels - are still easy to use on larger tablets and notebooks with touch screens.

## Touch shortcuts for diagramming on a tablet

While almost all features work just as well with a finger or pen as they do with a mouse, there are a few gesture shortcuts specific to touch screens.

The round highlights in the following tutorials show finger movements on an iOS touch screen. The gestures work similarly on other touch devices.

**Open the shape selector:** Double tap on a blank area to get the shape selection box and tap on a shape to add it to the drawing canvas.

**Type a label:** Double tap on the shape or connector to open the on-screen keyboard.

**Add a shape:** Tap on a shape to select it, then tap on one of the direction arrows and select a shape to add it in that direction. The newly added shape will be connected automatically. 

You can also tap on a shape in the shape library, or drag one from the shape library to the drawing canvas, just as you would with a mouse.

**Zoom in and out:** Pinch to zoom out, and spread two fingers on the touch screen to zoom in, just as you would when editing a photograph. You can also tap on the tools in the toolbar at the bottom right of the screen.

**Move the drawing canvas:** Tap and drag on a blank area of the drawing canvas to move to another position. Alternatively, use two fingers to drag the canvas as you zoom in and out.

**Rubberband selection:** Long tap on a blank area of the drawing canvas, then drag a selection box - a rubberband - around a group of shapes.

**Style shapes and connectors:** Tap on a shape to select it, or use the rubberband selection to select multiple shapes, then use the tools in the format panel to add colours and styles.

**Right-click context menu:** Tap on a blank area of the canvas to open the context menu for the page. Tap on a shape or connector to select it, pause slightly, then tap again to open the context menu.

If you tap twice too quickly (double tap), you'll start editing the label instead.

**Draw connectors:** Tap and drag a connector from one of the direction arrows and release it over another shape to connect them.

When you attach a connector, a blue outline on the target shape indicates a floating connector, a green outline indicates a fixed connector. [Floating and fixed connectors](/doc/faq/connector-fixed-vs-floating.html) can also be attached to freehand shapes. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/touch-diagrams-connectors.gif" style="width=100%;max-width:500px;height:auto;" alt="Tap and drag a connector from the direction arrows on one shape and release over another shape to connect the two">

Tap and drag the middle of a connector to change its path. Waypoints will be added and removed automatically as you drag it to a new position. 

Double tap on a connector to add a label. 

## Use the freehand brush

In the Sketch editor theme, tap on the freehand tool to open the floating dialog. If using the other editor themes, tap on _Arrange > Insert > Freehand_ in the menus above the drawing canvas. 

The freehand brush can draw different line widths. Click the _Brush_ checkbox and move the slider to the width you want to use.

The freehand tool works with a mouse or on a touchpad. Plus, it feels very natural with a pen when drawing on a tablet in draw.io.

## Prefer to work on a dark background?

**Use dark mode with the Sketch editor theme:** When you are using the Sketch whiteboard-like editor theme, tap on the menu icon then tap on _Settings > Appearance > Dark_ to toggle dark mode on or off.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/touch-diagrams-dark-mode.png" style="width=100%;max-width:500px;height:auto;" alt="Tap and drag a connector from the direction arrows on one shape and release over another shape to connect the two">

If you want to continue using a more complex editor theme in dark mode, tap on the menu, then select _Settings > Theme > Default_ and reload the browser tab. 

**Note:** When using draw.io from your home screen (below), close the application first, then reopen it from your home screen to use the new editor theme.

## Add draw.io to the home screen
To open the draw.io web app faster, add a shortcut to the web application on your home screen on your mobile device.

1. Go to the online editor at [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net), tap on the share button, then tap on _Add to home screen_. For example on iOS:

2. If you are asked, confirm that you want to add it to your home screen.
