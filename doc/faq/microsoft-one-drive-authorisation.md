When you first choose OneDrive as the storage location for your diagrams, you must authorise draw.io to allow it to access files there. Follow the steps below. 

1. Click _Authorize_ to start the OneDrive authorisation process.

2. If you haven't previously signed into OneDrive in this browser, sign into your account with your email address.
   * If prompted, choose the type of account you are signing into (_Work or school_, or _Personal_).

   * Enter your password and an authorisation code if prompted.
   * **Tip:** _Stay signed in_ so you won't have to log in again after a short time - click _Yes_. 
3. To store your diagram files in the main (root) folder of your OneDrive account, click _Yes_. Otherwise, select _No, pick folder_.
4. Navigate to the folder you want to use and click _Save_.

Now, your diagram files will be saved to the location you chose in your OneDrive account. 

As draw.io remembers your selected location, to save a file elsewhere, choose _Save as_ from the _File_ menu in the editor and select a different location.
