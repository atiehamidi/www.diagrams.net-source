The double click behaviour in draw.io has been updated in version 13.4.2 to be more convenient. Now, when you double click on the blank drawing canvas, you can quickly add a shape or text from the selector to your diagram.

You can choose from a range of common shapes from the _General_ shape library using this method.

**Tip:** These shapes will use the style you have set to be the default style.

## Set a new default style for shapes and connectors

The shapes will use the default style. You can easily set a new default style.

1. Add a shape or a connector and style it as you wish.
2. Select the shape, then in the _Style_ tab of the format panel on the right, click on _Set as Default Style_.

**Note:** You need to set new default styles for shapes and connectors individually.

**Keyboard shortcut:** ``Ctrl+Shift+D`` on Windows, or ``Cmd+Shift+D`` on macOS

### Clear the default style

If you no longer want to add shapes in your custom default style, you can reset draw.io to use the original default style.

1. Make sure nothing is selected.
2. In the _Style_ tab of the format panel on the right, click on _Clear Default Style_.

**Keyboard shortcut:** ``Ctrl+Shift+R`` or ``Cmd+Shift+R``
